With TutorCruncher's Extra Attributes, you can customise your system to record the information you need, when you need it.

</a>

## Apply them to users

Extra Attributes can be created for users profiles, so that you can save any information that is not included in the standard system, such as the date a DBS check expires for tutors, or which university a client wishes their child to attend.

They are filterable, so you can choose to view all of the tutors whose DBS check is going to expire within the next 10 days, or filter for all clients who can only be taught after 5pm.

You can even choose who can view them, so if you wish for only admins to view a certain attribute, such as their rating out of 10, you can do that.

</a>

## Apply them to jobs and lesson reports

Extra attributes can be attached to jobs, as well as lesson reports, allowing you to you create a custom lesson report for your company to give the client the information they want.
