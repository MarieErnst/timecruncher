We have integrated with a card payment system called [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) to help you take payment as quickly and easily as possible.

## Easy payment for clients

With our integrated card payment system, clients can pay an invoice by clicking the link in the automated email sent from TutorCruncher as soon as they receive it. The invoice is then marked as paid in the system so you don't have to lift a finger!

</a>

## Save card details

Your clients can choose to remember their card details to make future payments quicker still. This also gives admins the ability to take payments on their behalf if they allow it.

</a>

## Take payments over the phone

Admins have the ability to take card payments over the phone, so the entire process takes as little time out of your day as possible.

## Low rates

Credit card rates start from a tiny 1.4% + 20p per transaction, and can be found [here](/pricing#stripe-details). That's less than half of what PayPal charge at 3.4%.

Our partnership with Stripe means that you can negotiate your own rates to get the best deal.
