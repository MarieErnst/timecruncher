Jump Into Math was founded in 2005 by DeeAnn Moore Antonini as a private tutorial agency for mathematics. DeeAnn developed an intervention program that identifies a student’s mathematical needs and then delivers individualized instruction to build each students mathematical foundation. In 2006, Jump Into Math began to offer the tutorial program to school districts as a State Approved Supplemental Educational Service (SES) provider. In the past eight years, Jump Into Math has hired and trained hundreds of credentialed teachers to tutor while providing quality intervention to thousands of students throughout California. In 2009, due to the expansion of the business, DeeAnn brought her business consultant and brother, Terry Moore on as a partner. Terry has provided necessary business expertise for management, stability and growth. With Terry’s partnership, Jump Into Math has expanded to three locations with three products to serve our students, families and communities.
