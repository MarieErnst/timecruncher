Kumon Educational is the UKâ€™s largest supplementary education provider, offering maths and English study programmes for children of all ages and abilities. There are currently over 70,000 Kumon students learning at more than 680 study centres across the UK, with over 4 million students worldwide. The Kumon Method of Learning was developed in 1954 by Toru Kumon, both a parent and gifted teacher from Japan. He discovered his own son, Takeshi, was not fulfilling his potential in maths at school and so created worksheets for him to do at home every day.

Kumon Educational still stand firm to the founding principles outlined by Toru Kumon today. They believe all children have enormous and often untapped potential and that, through developing strong maths and English skills, they can experience all round academic success. They therefore believe all education must focus on delivering a maximum, long-term benefit to each individual child. All Kumon Instructors are skilled and committed individuals with a passion for education and a strong desire to see children develop. The Kumon Institute of Education was established in 1958; for over 50 years our unique method of learning has helped children across the globe to excel academically and develop a love of learning. At Kumon they care about each individual child and giving them the opportunity to succeed in the global community.
