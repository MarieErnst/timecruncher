At Totus Education they take a different approach. They are the most effective method of getting your child into their school of their choice. But they also help them succeed once they arrive there. Their aim is to guide, inspire and equip students as they help them become more confident and effective learners in both the short and the long term. They are mentors as much as they are teachers. They teach the child based on the interests they themselves have, and their unique personality. They teach a student how to learn and put their learning into context for them. In short, they teach the mind and not just the brain.

The Totus Education is built from the insight and personal experience of its founders, who have managed to attain places at the world’s top educational institutions – including one of the UK’s leading schools and Harvard University in the USA. The Totus Education system is a holistic one, comprising an integrated educational assessment, originally authored materials (created by exceptional graduates from Oxbridge and teachers with decades of experience) and true excellence in teaching. They combine teaching around the specific examination the student will sit, with unique techniques and strategies that ensure more rounded academic and personal development. In this way they not only ensure a student gets the results they need to go to their school of choice, they also ensure they will excel in the new educational landscape they face once there.

Education is still a golden ticket. But it much change to fit the times. It must be personalised. And it must empower students and their families. Those who teach their students must guide, equip and inspire the individual.
