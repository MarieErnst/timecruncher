The After-School Learning Centre, located in North London and Southgate caters for all children aged four to eighteen and is totally dedicated to helping your child achieve the best grades possible in English, Maths, Science, Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning and Mandarin through personalised and tailored one-to-one tutoring. All subjects are taught in lessons of one hour. You will find a regular day and time for your child to attend which fits your work commitments as we are open from Monday to Saturday.

Improvements in your child’s confidence and learning will occur quickly through being taught by a fully qualified, experienced and CRB checked teacher with a deep knowledge of the national curriculum – the key to rapid progress. Advances in your child’s learning are bolstered through the continuity of being with the same teacher for the duration of the subjects you choose for your child. The same teaching approach is adopted for high achieving and struggling children which is focused on teachers giving your child the time and finding multiple ways to patiently explain, motivate, reward and write down explanations until your child achieves an excellent understanding. Just as in SATs, GCSE, A Level and Entrance exams, your child will use traditional pencil and paper to work out maths calculations, answer comprehension questions, write sentences, essays, stories, undertake grammar and punctuation exercises.
