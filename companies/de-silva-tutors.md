De Silva Tutors introduce the highest level tutors for a range of ages and across a broad spectrum of subjects. They can
do this both residentially (in the UK and abroad) and non-residentially. Most of the tutors are Oxford and Cambridge
graduates and have achieved top grades in all the subjects they teach and generally top grades in all the subjects they
have ever taken. Potential tutors are all interviewed personally by Craig de Silva for approximately one hour. This way
it is possible to pick tutors who are not only academically excellent but in terms of communication skills and general
personality fit what is required to be an outstanding tutor.
