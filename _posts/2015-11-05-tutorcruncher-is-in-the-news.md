Tutor to the rich and famous, Thomas Murr has written a thought-provoking
article for estate and manor magazine about the long term prospects for both
tutoring agencies, and tutoring service providers like tutorcruncher. As many
of you know, tutoring companies are potentially lucrative businesses that can
be easy to start and then run with low overheads. However, these things are
equally true for your rivals and other looking to start out in the industry.
While at the moment it seems that the number of tutoring companies is
increasing all the time, so is the apparent demand for tutoring services.

Logic dictates that this cannot carry on in perpetuity and saturation in the
market will be reached, potentially quite soon. Then the future for tutoring
agencies is likely to be characterized by intense price and service-driven
competition and innovation, with those companies that respond quickest to to
market thriving and those which are unable to keep administrative costs low
and deliver a competitive product failing. In this context, products like
Tutorcruncher that optimize and automate administrative tasks will prove
invaluable as they allow those running tutoring companies to give their energy
not to the everyday operation of their business, but reaching new markets,
developing new products, and tackling the inevitable challenges that await in
the sector.
