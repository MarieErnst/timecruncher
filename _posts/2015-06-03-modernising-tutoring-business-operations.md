### Is Your Tutoring Business Still Using These Outdated Practices?

The tutoring industry is changing. The rise in technology and the increase in the numbers of new tutoring start-ups 
means that if you want to stay ahead of the game and establish your tutoring business as an authority, 
you need to move with the times.

Embracing change in business often means getting rid of old, unproductive practices in favour of more modern 
ways of thinking. If you’re still using outdated approaches to running your tutoring business, then you need to 
adapt your thinking to stay ahead of the game. 

### Competing Against Other Tutoring Businesses

One of the most recent trends in the tutoring industry is the shift in mindset from competition to collaboration. 
As the tutoring industry becomes ever more closely aligned, there are more opportunities out there than ever to grow 
your tutoring business through working with others. Many 
[tutoring businesses](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/news-and-updates/how-to-start-a-tutoring-business/) 
have begun partnering up with other companies in the education sector in order to grow their audience, 
increase student referrals and improve their brand awareness. In the not too distant future, the businesses 
that will experience significant growth will be those who make friends with their competitors, not rivals. 

### Teacher-Centred Tutoring

One of the biggest advantages private tutoring has over classroom teaching is the ability for tutors to give students 
their undivided attention and this means involving students in lesson planning. Rather than asking your tutors to take a 
teacher-centred approach, encourage them to work towards creating a culture of learning, where everyone’s opinions are 
valued and taken onboard. Private tutors come from a range of different backgrounds, and each has different experiences 
of education. The wealth of knowledge that many tutoring businesses have can be used to create a positive, 
[student-centred approach to learning](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/how-to-encourage-students-to-take-control-of-their-learning/), 
which improves student’s grades more effectively. 

### Selling Your Tutoring Services

How do you attract new students and parents to your business? Do you shout about your services on social media, 
pushing your messages to anyone who will listen? Or do you make the effort to engage with people, offering advice and 
resolving problems? The private tutoring industry is a busy place and there are many businesses, just like yours, all 
shouting as loud as they can to be heard. However, the way to stand out from the crowd in today’s marketplace is to start 
conversations, encourage interaction and grow your business by being an enabler for people to express their opinions. 

### Spreadsheets for Reporting

Keeping track of your tutoring business by using an Excel spreadsheet, simply doesn’t cut the mustard in today’s 
tech savvy marketplace. If you want to give a good impression to your students, parents and your tutors, then you 
need to use tutor-specific software that takes care of all your administration. That’s why we created 
[TutorCruncher](http://www.tutorcruncher.com) , a scheduling tool for the private tutoring industry that 
handles student invoicing, lesson plans and staff payments. TutorCruncher will significantly reduce the amount of 
time that you spend on administration, enabling you to focus on growing your tutoring business. _ Is your tutoring 
business still using these outdated practices? If so, which do you see as being the most prohibitive to your business growth?
