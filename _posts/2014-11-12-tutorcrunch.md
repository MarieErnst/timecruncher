that entrepreneurs often get hung up on when they are starting a tutoring
business is what to call their company. Here at TutorCruncher (or ‘Tutor
Crunch’ as we’re often called) we have spoken to hundreds of people at this
stage and have seen how they have progressed after finally settling on a name.

** The key points to think about are search engine optimisation
(SEO), brand message and ethos, how easily it rolls off the tongue and the
geographic and cultural restriction or focus.

### ** SEO

SEO is
becoming one of the major focuses of marketing a business. Online is the
number one way in which people will discover your business and therefore you
need to make it as easy as possible for them to do this. Therefore, it can be
a good idea to include the word ‘tutors’ or ‘tuition’ in your name to help the
search engines determine what you are about. Do some searches on Google for
‘tutors in London’ or ‘tutors in new york’ to get an idea of the competition
and always search on any potential names to discover whom you’ll be competing
against and the general SERP landscape around your future brand name.

### ** Brand Message and Ethos

Your company’s name is your first opportunity
to market yourself to your clients, and your tutors. Therefore you should try
to communicate your personality, professionalism, friendliness and even price
within the name. Something like ‘Belgravia Tuition’ sounds slightly higher end
and more expensive than ‘Budget tutors’ and it is immediately obvious when you
hear then names.

### ** Rolling off the Tongue

We decided on
TutorCruncher as the name for our business a few years ago, after not too much
thought and we felt it sounded friendly and easy to say. Now we are often
referred to as TutorCrunch, which on reflection, perhaps sounds better, and
being shorter is easier to say. We will have to think about whether or not we
should become Tutor Crunch in the future. 

### **

** ** geographic
restriction/focus ** With any business, specialisation and focus can be
extremely beneficial and advised. It is important, however, to not restrict
yourself from future expansion with your name. You can spend years building a
brand that has strength in the local market, but means nothing to people
abroad. It can also have a negative impact on non-local SEO to have a local
brand name. Some location names, such as Chelsea or California can have
international recognition that would not hinder your brand’s growth, but in
general I would avoid a location within the name. ** ** It is important not to
over think this and waste time trawling the internet and doing surveys just to
rule out your good ideas. A snappy, easy-to-remember name that speaks to your
clients in tutors in the correct tone is all you need. Your surname can often
work very well (depending on what it is...)
