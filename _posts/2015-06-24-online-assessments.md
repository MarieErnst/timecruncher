Many prep schools have or are in the process of
either significantly upgrading their IT teaching facilities or moving to a
totally mobile solution i.e. iPads or Chromebooks, which are booked out by
pupils on a daily basis. In addition, there has been considerable investment
in improving IT infrastructure, with the majority of prep schools now
benefitting from ultra-fast internet connections and, in some cases,
innovative school intranet solutions. These improvements keep the door firmly
wide open to enable paper examinations to move into the digital age. 

### Advantages

* Provides examination authors with a high level of  flexibility via online. 
* Auto-marking means that results are available on demand
* Saves examination boards and senior schools considerable amounts of time
* Examinations available in colour with attractive look and feel. 
* No requirement for dispatch of examination papers, which is both expensive and open to risk. 
* Works on PC, Mac, Chromebook, Android and iPad tablets
* Detailed insight into the results, offering comparative data analysis and breakdown. In September 2013, the ISEB 
agreed to trial an online Mandarin Chinese Level 1 specimen examination in preparatory schools. The Board has 
subsequently agreed to run Mandarin Chinese as a live exam this academic year and to provide Spanish as an online 
Level 1 specimen examination to further gauge interest amongst prep school pupils and teachers. 

Please see [www.e2focus.com/ISEB](http://www.e2focus.com/ISEB) for examples of the auto-
marking examination papers available to date. _ “The online trial versions of
ISEB’s Mandarin Chinese examination papers have been well received by both our
schools and our language teams. They are an exciting part of the Board’s
development plans and we look forward to offering more online assessments in
the future.” _ Ann Entwisle, Chief Administrator, Independent Schools
Examinations Board _ “School history was made this month at Hampton Court
House when its pupils became the first to sit a Common Entrance examination in
a live online format. The Common Entrance examinations, taken by all prep
school pupils, are set by ISEB.” _ Guy Holloway, Headmaster, Hampton Court
House School
