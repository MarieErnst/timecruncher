This is the first blog in our series about HOW to set up your very own
tutoring agency. From our own experience, the Bright Young Things Tuition Team
have brainstormed together and drummed out our top tips for you. We would
suggest that you ensure you are passionate about all aspects beneath the
umbrella of education before embarking on this endeavour! If affirmative, read
on... Time management and a concise business plan are crucial at this stage.
You need to establish 

### what

you are teaching, 

### where

you will tutor,
and 

### who

you will teach. For example - do you want to concentrate on
A-Levels, GCSE’s, IB, or University Applications? We’d suggest focussing on
one initially and then expanding into other branches in the future as you
grow. At this point it is probably best to concentrate on the topic/ stage
that you yourself are most familiar with.

With the correct research, analysis and preparation you will be able to find
the relevant gap in the market - [ your niche
](http://www.startupdonut.co.uk/startup/start-up-business-ideas/how-i-turned-
my-new-business-idea-into-a-successful-niche-job-site) \- and this is where
you will want to direct your business towards. Look at your competitors’
offerings and see if you can find any components that they are missing. You
want to be new and innovative whilst objectively looking at other tutoring
companies in your areas' pros and cons. Think realistically about the
boundaries that your geographical area can fall within - considering travel
time and transport costs, alongside whether you can viably secure mobile
tutors. These observations will form the basis of your [ business plan
](https://www.gov.uk/write-business-plan) which can then be infused with your
own ideas to rival your competitors’ business models and offerings. If you
discover that there is in fact a demand, and that you can cater to meet that
need, you are on your way to consolidating your market position - a necessary
point to reach before you can go about implementing your business plan.
