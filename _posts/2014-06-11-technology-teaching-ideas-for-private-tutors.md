Introducing technology into private tutoring sessions can be a great way to
keep students motivated and engaged with lesson content. Nowadays, most
students are already proficient at using technology in their everyday lives
and with a little creativity; tutors can introduce it into lessons to aid the
learning process. We’ve put together a list of some technologies you can use
during lessons to make them more interesting.

### Websites

There are an abundance of websites out there that you can make use of during
lessons. Particularly with younger students, revision websites can be a great
way to test their knowledge and understanding of a particular subject or to
act as revision material for topics you’ve already covered. For older
students, websites are a great resource for encouraging independent study.
Many students learn better when they’re given the freedom to study a subject
on their own rather than being taught completely by a tutor. What’s more,
introducing websites into lessons also helps develop a student’s research
skills, which are essential if they plan on continuing their education at
university level.

### PowerPoint

Another great way to vary the structure of lessons is to introduce PowerPoint presentations. Tutors can collate presentations by themselves or find pre-made presentations from various resource-sharing websites. Particularly good for [ exam revision ](http://www.brightyoungthings.co.uk/parents-blog/2014/5/7/how-to-help-your-child-prepare-for-exams) , PowerPoints often appeal to students who are visual learners or prefer to learn by experiencing things for themselves. Because PowerPoints are more interactive than other traditional tutoring methods, students often retain the information they learn more easily. Tutor should also encourage students to create their own PowerPoints, based on what they’ve learned throughout a particular topic. These presentations can also form the basis of revision material when exam time comes. 

### Smart Boards

An alternative to traditional blackboards, smart boards are great for teaching groups of students. Many tuition agencies have smart boards installed in their classrooms and they can be used in a variety of different ways. Combining white board markers with touch screen technology, smart boards are connected to a computer to provide an interactive learning experience. Rather than just a means of displaying information, smart boards are able to save work and send it to other computers. Smart boards also have internet access, meaning that tutors have access to a whole range of different learning materials at the click of a button. 

### IPads

Mobile devices like iPads are great tools to bring along to lessons and nowadays, you can buy plugin keyboards that allow students to type as they would on a laptop. Great for watching instructional videos, iPads can often provide a welcome break from traditional tutoring methods as they’re interactive and allow students to carry out their own research on topics that stem from their course work. IPads also allow lessons to be taken outside of the classroom like in a coffee shop or library. Sometimes changing the location of lessons can be of great benefit to a student’s learning. 

_ Do you use technology in any of your lessons? If so, which do you find the
most effective in engaging students? What other advantages do you see to using
technology as a tutor? We’d love to hear your thoughts on this. _
