With _ 73% of the UK population now online _ , the internet has quickly become
the most popular tool for searching for information. From a tutoring agency’s
perspective, this means that people are more likely to be searching for your
services online than anywhere else. So how do you ensure that your agency has
a strong online presence? Well, [ The Tutor Website
](http://thetutorwebsite.co.uk/) has written this handy guide to help agencies
like yours, build an online community that will promote your services and
convert your interactions into sales.

### Having the Right Conten

t No-one is going to find your business online unless you have a good spread of content out there. Start by posting relevant articles on your blog regularly, so that search engines can establish your agency as an authority in the tuition industry. By posting high quality articles that add value to your website visitors, you’ll soon find people engaging in conversations on your comments section. This interaction can provide the perfect opportunity for you to lend a helping hand by offering your tuition services. Try to make your website content different from your competitors and give some thought to the keywords you want to rank for in search engines. Standing out from the crowd is the key to engaging an audience online. 

### Getting Social

Creating great content for your blog is all well and good but if no-one finds it; it’s a pretty pointless exercise. That’s where social media comes in. By posting your content on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus, you’ll encourage others to share what you’ve written. Reply to people’s comments on social media and engage them in conversation. Ask them how you can help and before you know it, you’ll have made a connection that could lead to a new tutor registration or a series of lessons for a new student. Remember, the key to social media is quality engagements not quantity. 

### Guest Posting

Despite Google’s recent announcement that _ guest posting is dead _ , as long as you focus on adding value in your post, and you don’t pay for links, writing for someone else’s website can be a great way to win over new fans. Choose your websites to post on carefully; ideally you’ll want to post on a website in a similar industry to yours. 

### Getting Chatty in Online Forums

Every tuition agency should ask themselves where their audience is likely to hang out. One possible answer to this is on online forums. People turn to forums for advice and information about private tuition all the time. Some of my favourite forums are _ TES Connect’s private tutor forum _ and _ Money Saving Expert’s private tutor thread _ . It’s definitely worth having a presence on these sites as they can be a great way to make new connections and build your tutoring community. And be sure to say hello if you ever come across The Tutor Website on any of these websites. What are your experiences of building an online tutoring community? Do you have any other ideas you’d like to add to the list?
