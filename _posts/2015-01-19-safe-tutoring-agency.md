One of
the most essential things that students look for when choosing a tutoring
agency is how safe the learning environment is. As an agency, it’s your
responsibility to ensure that you provide [ a safe, secure place for students
to study ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/tuition-agency-ethics/) . We’ve
created a safety checklist to ensure that your agency has all the safety boxes
ticked. 

### General Office Safety

 All the principles of office safety apply
to tutoring agencies too. Make sure that all new students are given a tour of
your agency where you make them aware of all the emergency exits and fire
evacuation points. You should also ensure that students are trained in how to
use any specialist equipment and that your office is free from potential
health hazards. With people moving around in your office all day, it can be
easy for boxes to be knocked over or for computer wires to become trip
hazards. Make sure you keep your offices clean, tidy and hazard free so as to
avoid the potential for accidents. 

### DBS Checks for Tutors

 Students and
parents will want to know that the tutors you employ have been appropriately
vetted. A good tutoring agency will ensure that each of their staff undergoes
a Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS) as part of their [ recruitment
process ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/how-to-recruit-tutors-for-your-agency/)
. Agencies should also check their employees’ references before offering them
a position as previous work records are just as important as criminal
background checks. 

### Data Protection

 Because tutoring agencies work with
young people, staff should be aware of your agency’s data protection policy.
They should be aware of what information they are able to disclose to parents
and other organisations and which disclosures would be considered a breach of
policy. Agencies should be particularly aware about giving out personal
information about students, particularly phone numbers and home addresses. You
should also have a record of each student’s parents or guardians and emergency
contacts in case you need to verify anything that may need a parent or
guardian’s consent. 

### Create Open Spaces

 Students are more likely to feel
secure [ studying in an open plan environment
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/how-to-make-your-tutoring-agency-stand-out/)
where they are in full view of the rest of the office. It can be a good idea
to create open spaces as much as possible in your agency rather than having
separate rooms for tuition. Glass rooms can work particularly well for
creating an open plan feel. If it isn’t possible to create open spaces in your
agency, it can be a good idea to adopt an open door policy, where every room
must have their doors open. Not only does this create a safer environment but
it makes students feel more secure as well. What steps do you take to ensure
your tutoring agency is a safe place for students? Do you have any points that
you’d like to add to our checklist? We welcome your thoughts.
