When was the last time you booked a cab over the phone? Or, for that matter, a hotel room, or a even a takeaway pizza? 
We have become more and more accustomed to the business of browsing options ourselves, reading reviews, and now third 
party websites help compile reviews and produce price comparisons for us so that we don’t even have to do that. 
New generations of users are increasingly unaccustomed to picking up the phone for anything at all, 
as the adage goes “there’s an app for that”, and why should tutoring be any different?

Having started out as a bespoke personal service, the appeal of tutoring is constantly broadening and many people want 
what is now a more traditional web-based customer experience where they can browse at leisure, read reviews and profiles 
of tutors and book things on their own terms. One of the things that this demands is a much more comprehensive and 
intricate web presence to ensure a seamless user-experience. Your web presence is no longer a portal into a business, 
it becomes your business. It is no longer enough for static content to reassure a customer of your credentials and ability 
to provide a good service, but the quality and optimization of the interactions your website provides are the service you 
provide. And these days customers are more likely to be browsing on a phone or a tablet than they are a computer monitor 
and producing dedicated apps is the easiest way of guaranteeing a quality of experience, but also introduces a barrier to 
use - people have to download before they browse.

While a traditional tutoring company is relatively cheap and easy to establish and run with few overheads, high-volume 
web-based systems are expensive to build and maintain. But given that customers assume they can find the best prices online 
themselves for almost all products and services, the traditional model also provides a barrier to customers looking to book 
a tutor so the investment could have huge trade offs.

In our web-based world we are also familiar with the frustration of browsing yourself between numerous options that you don’t 
even feel qualified to assess. Customer reviews online are notoriously inaccurate and also subject to abuse - so as users we 
refer to expert reviews and opinions and by the time we have spent many hours doing it ourselves it would have been more efficient 
to pay someone to do that work for us. Hence the market for high-end bespoke services which require trust in a company to make good decisions on your behalf.

In most markets there is space for both models, a lower-priced higher volume model and a much higher-priced, smaller volume 
system. The clients have contrasting needs and if tutoring companies try and please everyone, they risk satisfying no one.
