](/img/blogs/Christmas-Dino.jpg) The latter weeks of December are
usually among the quieter times for tutoring agencies. As students and staff
prepare for the festive season, for a few weeks at least, the industry starts
to drop off a little. Not surprisingly, as a [ tutor agency director
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/what-makes-a-good-tuition-agency-director/) ,
you might find yourself with a little bit more time on your hands than usual.
We suggest you take advantage of the Christmas drop off in the following ways:

### Tidy up Paperwork

With so much admin to keep on top of throughout the
year, it’s easy to put off seemingly less important tasks until the end of the
year. Well, now is the time to attend to those tax returns, pay those
outstanding invoices and generally make sure that all your finances are up to
date. Clearing up outstanding paperwork will enable you to start the New Year
afresh without still feeling tied to 2014. Perhaps most importantly, make sure
that all your tutors have been paid what they’re owed in time for the
holidays. 

### Create your Marketing Strategy for the New Year

For any
business, December is a time for reflection, for calculating your growth and
for patting yourself on the back for a job well done. However, it’s also a
time for looking ahead and deciding what your [ marketing strategy
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/digital-marketing-strategy-can-help-grow-
tuition-agency/) should be for 2015. Consider which parts of your business
have developed over the last 12 months and how you can ensure their success
next year. Also think about any new projects that you’ve undertaken, were they
successful or did they fall short of expectation? Decide whether you should
continue working on those projects that didn’t quite make it off the ground or
if you should realign your focus and take a different approach to ensure their
success. 

### Consider a Recruitment Drive

Did you know that Monday the 7  th
January is the day that most people start looking for new jobs? For a tutoring
agency, this could be good and bad in equal measure. Some tutors who work part
time may decide that it’s time for them to move on, whereas others may find
themselves looking for opportunities to [ work with tutoring agencies

yours. In the New Year, it’s not only staff that gets itchy feet either. With
exams fast approaching, students usually start looking for extra help around
January time, so make sure your doors are open and that you’re prepared with
enough staff to meet with demand. 

### Plan New Year Promotions

January is
the perfect time to run promotions to encourage an uptake of your services.
Take advantage of a slow December by planning how you’re going to attract new
business in the New Year. What special offers and promotions will you run? It
takes time to plan a promotion so best start early and put a plan in place for
when the time comes. Many tutoring agencies organise open days in January to
attract new students and staff, so consider what arrangements you’ll need to
make if you plan on having one yourself. What are your experiences of December
in a tutoring agency? How do you deal with the quieter periods? Do you begin
planning for the New Year? If so, what ideas would you like to add to your
list? We’d be keen to hear your thoughts.
