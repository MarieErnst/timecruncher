TutorCruncher is about to release its most substantial update within the next
2 days. 

### New Features:

 

### Balance and Available Balance



  * The Balance and Available Balance Features work in a very similar way to most online banking systems. 
  * The Balance Feature tracks a client's actual balance - i.e - the balance tracks all paid invoices and administration charges and the total of any prepayments a client has made. 
  * The Available Balance Feature gives the administrator a live update of the outstanding balance - i.e - the total of all prepayments minus all outstanding lessons and administration charges. 
  * The difference between the two balances shows the total outstanding amount for the client in TutorCruncher. 
  * The new User Balance option when paying an invoice allows the administrator to pay the invoice with the Client's balance and not log a new payment in the system. It is ideal if your business runs a pre-payment system. 
  * ‘Outstanding balance’ is the tutors equivalent of the client's Balance Feature. This displays the total outstanding monies from all lessons logged in the system. This is calculated by the tutor. 


### Balance Feature Workflow Examples.

 

### Basic Post-Pay



  * A client opens an account. The Balance and Available Balance equal £0.00. 
  * A £50 Administration Charge and a £50 lesson are logged. Available Balance drops to £-100.00, Balance stays at £0.00. (At this point the Administrator and Client can easily see the full outstanding amount due to payments logged in TutorCruncher). 
  * Invoice generated. 
  * Client pays £100, invoice is marked as paid, Available Balance rises up to £0.00. 


### Basic Pre-Pay



  * A client opens an account with a £1000 credit. 
  * A £50 administration charge and a £50 lesson are logged. Available Balance drops to £900.00, balance stays at £1000. (At this point the administrator and client can easily see there has been £100 of charges made but they have not been finalised in the system) 
  * Invoice generated. 
  * Administrator marks the invoice is marked as paid using the UserBalance feature, which does not create a payment history but uses the clients balance to pay the invoice. 
  * Available balance stays at £900 and Balance drops to £900 


### Crediting an Invoice



  * There are many ways you can complete the crediting of an invoice. 
  * If the invoice has not been generated all lessons and charges can be edited. 
  * If an invoice has been generated but not been paid and an item is incorrect there are two options. The invoice is deleted and the Administrator edits the incorrect item and re-issues the invoice. The Available Balance will take the change into account. The balance will adjust down to the available balance amount when the new invoice is marked as paid. 
  * The second option, if the full amount is incorrect, is to use the Credit Function. This will re-adjust the Available Balance and change the outstanding amount on the invoice accordingly. 
  * If an invoice has been paid there are now two ways to amend the issue. One option would be to refund the client outside the system. The other option is to offer a Top-Up within the system. The client's Balance increases and the extra credit can be used against future lessons. 


### Commission Sharing



  * Commission sharing allows the agency to split their commission with another agency/tutor/client who recommends a new client. 
  * The percentage split is set on the Tutor's Profile. If a client or an agency recommends a client, a basic tutor profile can be created for the client or agency to record the split of commission. 


### Schedule



  * The 'Schedule' documents all your lessons in a handy calendar format. 
  * Lessons by a specific tutor or client can be found using the Search tool. 
  * Lessons can be moved through the ‘Drag and Drop’ Feature. 


### Other Features:



  * Ability to not bill a job through the Invoicing and Billing Platform 
  * Many other bug fixes and minor improvements.
