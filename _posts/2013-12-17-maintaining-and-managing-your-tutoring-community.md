As you, our audience, will be well aware, tutoring really is a people-
orientated industry. The most successful tutoring companies will be those that
build up a versatile and qualified tutoring community to match their
clientele. Without the innovation of agency management software, such as
TutorCruncher, keeping track of the personal aspects of the tutoring world can
be an inconceivable challenge. TutorCruncher empowers its partners to overcome
this hurdle by ensuring that your agency has an all-round perception of its
clients - this can range from tracking pupils’ primary schools, academic
results, and birthdays, to their interests. The tutor biography also conveys
an impression of the tutor’s extracurricular achievements. This extensive
overview of both the pupil and tutor enables your agency to make a perfect
match. Connecting a pupil and tutor with a common shared interest is always an
ice-breaker and the key to a successful learning platform! Inciteful tutor
management will encourage your tutoring agency to grow. Your investment in
TutorCruncher will ensure that your staff can be relieved from the swamp of
admin and concentrate on the side of the industry that really matters -
building and developing relations.
