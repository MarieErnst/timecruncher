According to a survey conducted by 
[EdPlace](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/9651689/Parents-spend-6bn-a-year-on-private-tuition.html), 
the private tuition market in the
UK reached a value of £6 billion last year. The research found that more than
a quarter of UK families are willing to spend up to £2,758 per year per child.
Despite the average cost per hour, which is raised to £22, parents are ready
to invest in their children's education, in order to secure them a better
career in the future.

The survey also showed that more than a third of parents who are utilising
private tutors blame schools not providing an adequate level of support to
their children. They consider private tutors more effective and able to make
the difference between success and failure when it comes to passing exams like
11+, GCSE and A Level. An article from 
[The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/9651689/Parents-spend-6bn-a-year-on-private-tuition.html) 

also reported a significant increase
in the number of nine and 10-year-olds being given coaching to pass entrance
tests, as well as rising numbers of pupils who are being entered for the 11+.
If your aim is starting your own tuition agency, or you already have one, you
should not miss this opportunity to grow and push your business forward.

The private tuition industry is one of the fastest growing industries, and now
is the time to capitalise
