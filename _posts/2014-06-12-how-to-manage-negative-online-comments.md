Digital Marketing is a tool used by almost every company in the world
nowadays. Unfortunately, online reputation management is neglected by many of
them who should pay much more attention to it, especially when receiving
negative comments. The internet is a completely open forum where people can
express their opinion on what you are doing, whether you like it or not.

Imagine you own a business and you try to sell a good or a service. In the
past, the review of a service or good would be left to professional critics
and influential writers. Now, a widely read review could come from any one of
your customers and the platforms on which they are published are much more
wide ranging now. As well as insensitivising a more consistently good
performance of the service you offer, this also creates the job of reputation
management. Everything seems to work well and then you suddenly realize that
your sales are going down. You look for the name of your company on the
internet and what you find right after your webpage is another site containing
a review from a client who had a bad experience. This is damaging for your
reputation, and will often require some sort of action. The review is not a
problem itself without an audience. The problem comes when the review appears
in the search engine results page (SERP). Below you can find here 5 tips to
help you improve your digital marketing strategy. 

### Social Media

They can
have two impacts on your business. At first search engines give more weight to
real updates. If you are really active, your updates will come first, pushing
down the negative comments. Secondly, even if you cannot deal with the
negative review, you can address those comments and try to make it up to the
customers. There are examples where ignoring comments have exacerbated the
situation but approaching negative reviewers is a delicate art and your social
media team should tread carefully here. 

### SEO

Search Engine Optimization
is a process that allows you to get a higher ranking on SERPs. If,
unfortunately, a negative comment comes on the first page, it means that this
ranking site is outranking your pages on your site. A good SEO strategy could
help you improve your ranking for core keywords, but also enhance how your
content ranks. These will add search value to your site and push the negative
comments down the SERPs. 

### Publishing

Developing new domains is crucial.
Some may already exist on different platforms, you just have to create your
own page and immerse yourself in the non-stopping world of social media.
Improve you Wikipedia page, your Twitter, your blog, Facebook, Tumblr,
Pinterest, Youtube, Google+, etc. The more you interact with your audience,
the better it will be for your business and the higher you will rank on search
engines. 

### Content

You need to publish high quality content on every
platform on which you're present. It can be either pictures, videos, blog
post, or anything related to the industry you're in. We recommend you create a
SEO agenda and stick to it. It may be easier said than done, but with negative
comments on review sites it is difficult to win new customers.
