Many offices are trying to be more environmentally friendly, that way they
spend less money on printing and also keep their office tidier and paperless.
However, going paperless has other advantages such as keeping information more
secure. Working in a paperless office can be easier, but how to get there is
definitely not. Nevertheless, here you can find four tips to help you make the
change. 

### Use The Cloud

Even without paper, you need to stock your data
somewhere. However, if all your data is on a local computer, the risk of
losing the information is higher. What is more, this type of storing will
limit the access to it from outside the office. This is why we suggest you use
a cloud-based solution, such as Dropbox. It will allow you to access your
documents from anywhere, it requires no backup and you can choose among
different permission levels. 

### Start Up With Accounting Department

This
department is probably the one with the greatest need for high quality data.
Going paperless will be arduous in terms of bookkeeping, billing, receivable
invoices, etc., but in the end it could be the most cost effective and
efficient upfront solution for your business. 

### Conduct Paperless Meetings

When you go to a meeting try to project a presentation to show your key
figures, reports, initiatives and projects to your attendees. You can also
encourage your team to take notes, make to-do lists and set appointments using
Notepad, Google Tasks and Google Calendar respectively. ** Discourage Printing
** It is probably the first thing to do if you want to stop filling your
office with papers. You should remove every desktop printers from your office
and try to allocate one or two heavy-duty printers nearby. We also recommend
you track down every employee's printing and to inform them this activity will
be closely monitored. [
