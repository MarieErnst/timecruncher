Starting a tuition agency involves dealing with many administrative tasks.
From matching clients and tutors to tracking lessons, good organisational
skills are essential to operate your business. Being disorganised could affect
the reputation of your brand  . Being unreliable or making mistakes will
damage your business financially, particularly at the early stages of the
business.

Learning the ropes is a challenging time for an your agency, coupled with a
need to succeed is a very demanding environment for the first few months.
Planning is vital y  ou will have to think about a way to produce client
invoices, manage tutors payment orders and, of course, manage your accounts.
So, how are you going to do that? Do you hire a member of staff? If thatâ€™s the
case, acquiring good information from a  law  yer and accountant is important.
Issues like employee contracts, rights, payslips and NI/income tax have to be
considered. It also means that you would have to look after those people to
make sure they are doing their work effectively, so training is important.
Getting your administration set up is important and can be overlooked. How you
decide to operate make sure your set up is well planned and staff are well
trained.  Of course we couldn't write a blog about organisation and
administration without mentioning TutorCruncher. Instead of spending your time
taking care of the boring administrative tasks, you let TutorCruncher do it
for you. Using this efficient software will enable you to grow your business
as you grow relationships with your  clients  , instead of managing invoices.
