TutorCruncher has recently developed a new feature for Scheduling, with the
aim to help you streamline your business and save even more time than before.

This tab will enable you to organise lessons by automatically putting them
into a timetable when they are added into a job. It will display the lesson
timetable and allow you to move lessons by dragging and dropping the tabs on
the calendar.

We hope you'll find this useful. For any problems or question, please do not
hesitate to get in touch with us.
