The increase in both the quantity and importance of examinations has gone hand in hand with the rise of private tutoring. A pupil’s performance in a handful of exams might be the single factor that determines potentially life-changing moments - securing a place at an historic boarding school or university. If performance in a single set of 11+ exams could save a parent £100k in school fees by gaining entry into a selective state grammar it is no wonder parents are willing to invest big money in getting their children over the line.

The announcement that Cambridge is to reintroduce its own assessments to complement the interview process can only mean one thing - more work for tutors. Oxbridge interview preparation is infamously difficult and imprecise. How exactly do you prepare a student for a “Would you rather be an apple or a banana?” style question. A Cambridge spokesperson is quoted as saying that “No advance preparation will be needed” and it is likely that the exams will be designed to be difficult to prepare for as they are primarily interested in determining academic potential rather than existing knowledge, but this is not to say that preparation won’t help. With the Cambridge exams happening at the end of a busy term in December, maybe tuition companies should get in early and offer intensive Summer sessions that specifically cater to Oxbridge examinations. Whilst companies like Oxbridge Applications offer interview preparation, they only help with one aspect of a multi-stage application procedure. There are already comprehensive services that help with school entry but why not a similar service for Oxbridge? With their expertise tutoring companies could be charging top dollar for a complete package that includes college selection, exam preparation, interview practice and personal statement writing.
