As software developers, we could talk all day about the functionality and
features of TutorCruncher’s management software, but to be honest, none of
that really matters unless our customers  find the product reliable and easy
to use  . Here are a few things that we believe makes good tutoring management
software.

######

######

Access to Support  

We’re not just talking good supporting documents here, but access to live
online and telephone support, whenever you need it.  Finding solutions to
technical problems  could take you hours  but  can be cleared up in a matter
of minutes if you have access to a techn  ical support team. At TutorCrun  c
h  er, we offer  telephone  and email support as well as providing  [ online
tutorials  ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/tutorials/) and  a  [ user guide
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/user-guide/) for our customers.

Usability  

A business management system may pull out all the stops when it comes to
offering the latest technology, but at its core, unless it offers ease  of
use,  added extras won’t really serve any purpose.

[ Tutoring management software  ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/choose-best-
tuition-centre-software/) needs to be intuitive for the user  . Business
owners  need to be able to navigate the system easily, without having to refer
to instructions and documentation all the time. At TutorCruncher, we
thoroughly test our product whenever we introduce any new  updates or add any
new features. This ensures  that our customers  are happy with the changes and
more importantly, will find them useful.

Functionality  

Second to usability, tutoring software needs to actually fulfil a purpose and
make  business operations run smoothly. It needs to address the most common
issues that tutoring businesses face when it comes to daily operations and
offer a valuable, reliable solution to these issues. Many good business
software companies will also have a team of researchers, who work closely with
customers to ensure that their products meet the needs of the industry.

Accuracy and  Reliability  

When a user subscribes to a new software programme, they  want  it to work as
planned, every time, without any issues. The software needs to do exactly as
it promises and enable for accurate recording, invoicing and payment handling.
At TutorCruncher, we take the reliability of our product one step further by
making it accessible from anywhere in the world. Our tutoring business
software is hosted on the cloud, so that users aren’t restricted to accessing
their database only from their own PC or laptop.

Value for Money  

Whatever  [ tutoring business software
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/5-advantages-using-tuition-centre-software/)
you choose,  it needs to offer you value for money. Software companies need to
understand their marketplace well enough to be able to identify how much users
are willing to pay for their product. Whereas pricing at the high end of the
spectrum can help attract some of the bigger clients in the industry  , doing
so will exclude smaller  start-up business who are working with a much
tighter  budget.  The key is to offer flexible pricing.  It’s important that
the software you choose for your tutoring business is fairly and competitively
priced according to your needs.

above do you think are the most important when choosing tutoring software? Do
