There are several advantages to using an independent tuition agency not least
that students receive a custom made learning experience that they don’t get
elsewhere. When we talk about an independent tutoring agency, we mean one that
has been set up to stand alone and isn’t part of a franchise or other larger
group of businesses. 

### Tailor Made Learning

Independent agencies often
specialise in specific subjects that schools and franchises don’t. They’re
often more flexible and more able to adapt their lessons to suit the learning
preferences of individual students. Every student has their own learning style
and independent agencies are better able to match students with tutors.
There’s much to be said for the flexibility that independent agencies offer
and this one of the main attractions for parents in choosing them for their
children. 

### Investment in Resources

You’ll normally find that independent
tutoring agencies continually invest in their business, which means that they
keep up to date with the [ latest educational materials and technologies
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/technology-teaching-ideas-for-private-tutors/
"Technology Teaching Ideas for Private Tutors" ) . Because independent
agencies aren’t part of a chain, they’re able to make decisions about things
like learning materials quicker than franchises, which means that their
students will always be on the cutting edge of new educational technology.
What’s more, independent agencies tend to offer more resources per student and
the quality of the technology tends to be higher than in classrooms too. ** A
Personal Touch ** Independent agencies offer a personal touch that many larger
organisations can’t. Because independent agencies tend to be smaller, tutors
are given more opportunities to get to know their students better. Independent
agencies also have more of an investment in the local area and will better
understand the needs of the local community. The difference between learning
one to one and learning in a classroom environment is the focused attention
that students receive from a more personalised approach. If a student is
struggling with a specific aspect of a subject, a tuition agency will pick up
on it right away and give students the opportunity to [ be a part of resolving
the issue ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/how-to-encourage-students-to-take-
control-of-their-learning/ "How to Encourage Students to Take Control of Their
Learning" ) . 

### Creating a Community

Independent agencies create a
learning community in a way that other, larger organisations don’t. Because
most independent agencies don’t have the budget for TV ads or other forms of
mass advertising, they rely on word of mouth within a local area. It’s because
of this localised approach that independent agencies are keen to [ create a
community of learners ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/maintaining-and-managing-
your-tutoring-community/ "Maintaining and Managing your Tutoring Community…" )
rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach to education. What’s more, people
appreciate the value that a local, independent agency can bring to a community
as they create jobs and enable people to pursue an array of opportunities. [
