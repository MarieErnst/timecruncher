Whether you run a private tuition agency, an online tuition agency, a home tutoring agency or a tuition centre,
your key to running a profitable business, particularly as you grow in size, will be how to reduce the cost of,
and time spent on, admin.

The biggest cause of a tuition business failing is that the cost of the administration both in money and
time becomes crippling. As you grow your company and find that admin is taking more of your time, you have
to make a decision to:

1. Carry on and risk losing money and clients.
2. Employ more staff.
3. Find yourself software such as TutorCruncher that will reduce the time and cost of the admin.

Option 1 is a high risk strategy. As you spend more and more time invoicing and trying to match your ever increasing
numbers of tutors to your ever increasing number of students you run the risk of making mistakes, thus alienating your
clients. The service that you want to be offering your clients is no longer possible and you will inevitably lose both
clients and tutors.

Option 2 is one way to solve your admin problems but is an expensive and short term solution. Whilst it may solve the
short term problems with your administration, it reduces your profits and does not facilitate you growing further without
the additional cost of more admin staff. On top of their salary there is the cost of their national insurance and pension
contributions.

Option 3 is the simplest and most cost effective option. For as little as £35 per month you could have TutorCruncher
doing the admin for your tuition agency or centre. Not only will TutorCruncher will do all your scheduling, invoicing
and payroll, but the quality of your service provided will be better as you find it quicker to match your tutors to suit
every client’s individual needs, using features such as internal job board, and filtering tutors by the subjects they teach.
By allowing access to tutors, clients and students on a cloud based system, much of the admin of the admin is spread amongst
the users on the system. With the integration of the Stripe Card Payment System and GoCardless Direct Debits, payments can be
taken automatically from within TutorCruncher.

If you take the average salary of an admin to be £15,000 not including pension and national insurance contributions,
a TutorCruncher Premium plan of £99 per month would be saving your business £13,800/year, whilst giving yourself the time
to supply the service your clients expect!
