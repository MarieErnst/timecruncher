A lot of people avoid monitoring the financial side of their initial business
plan. However, before you are generating a steady income it is vital to
consider and consolidate your budget. Your plan should begin with a lot of
careful research into the realistic amount you can earn from tuition per month
– considering factors such as hourly rate for each level, average hours per
month per client, and the average amount you have to pay your tutors per hour.
You should use a [ spreadsheet program ](http://spreadsheet-software-
review.toptenreviews.com/) , such as Excel, in order to effectively gauge your
progress and lay-out your prospective plans.It is perhaps better not to be
overly optimistic when working out your monthly objectives or targets.
However, reasonable assumptions are necessary to ensure that you are not
operating at a loss. These should also account for a certain amount of growth
as the company progresses over its first year.

If you fail to meet these monthly objectives then your business plan targets
will allow you to realise this. It’s important to keep track of how you may
not be fulfilling these aims. When you are made aware of the problem early
enough you can solve it. For example, if you haven’t got ten new clients this
month and that was your goal ask yourself 

### why

and do something about it.
You could potentially persuade your tutors to recruit for you by sending a
group email round, (using a program like [ MailChimp ](http://mailchimp.com/?p
id=GAW&source=website&gclid=CMeGrou-t7sCFTMdtAodu28AZQ) depending on your
database size) and offering them a reward (such as [ Starbuck’s vouchers
](https://www.starbucks.co.uk/card) ) if they successfully introduce new
students to you. You can also consider investing more money in advertising and
cutting the time you spend on administration to focus on marketing and
generating new business.

By thinking outside the box you can iron out any problems in the initial
stages that aren’t adding up to what you want. Every start-up will have its
peaks and troughs – not letting them carry you away is all that matters.
