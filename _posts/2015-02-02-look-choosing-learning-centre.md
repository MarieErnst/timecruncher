The benefits of using a learning centre are well documented in parenting
circles and online forums. But how do you know which learning centre to
choose? What should you look for in a credible tutoring company? We’ve put
together a checklist of things to consider when making your choice. ** A High
Success Rate ** Every learning centre measures their success slightly
differently. Some report on their pass rate achievements, whereas others
prefer to measure results against students’ goals and expectations. In any
case, it’s important to find out how successful a potential agency has been in
the past and how this could benefit your learning. A credible agency will have
this information readily available and may even be able to provide you with a
report detailing their achievements further. ** Knowledgeable and Approachable
Tutors ** As a student, it’s important to know that your tutor is
knowledgeable in the subject they teach. Try to arrange an introductory
meeting with your tutor so you can ask any questions and decide if you think
you’ll get along. You should also enquire about the tutor’s qualifications and
experience. Having the knowledge to teach a subject is one thing, but just as
importantly, you’ll want your tutor to be friendly and approachable. You can
generally determine the quality of a learning centre by how approachable and
willing their tutors are.

Parents ** When choosing a learning centre, it can help to gather the opinions
of other students and parents. When visiting a learning centre for the first
time, have a chat with existing students to see how they find the service. Ask
them how studying at the centre has helped them in their learning. Where
possible, it’s also a good idea to speak to parents to gauge how successful
they think the centre’s tutoring programme is. Most learning centres will also
be able to provide a list of testimonials from previous students that can aid
your decision. 

### Online Reviews

Over the last few years, there’s been a
significant increase in the number of online review websites. These sites can
provide you with some useful, unbiased insights into what learning centres are
really like. Google reviews are a particularly useful source of information as
are online parenting and student forums. It’s worth bearing in mind however,
that people are more likely to leave reviews of a service if they’ve had a bad
experience rather than if they’ve had a positive one, so don’t be put off if
your preferred agency doesn’t have a 5 star rating. Are you currently studying
at a learning centre? How did you decide which one was the most suitable for
your learning needs? Do you have any points that you’d like to add to our
checklist? We’d be keen to hear your input.
