](/img/blogs/social_media_marketing_2015_11.png) According to
social media experts [ Social Media Examiner
](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-predictions-
for-2015/) , big changes are afoot in the world of social media this year.
With video and local search playing a big role in how businesses will market
their services, we’ve compiled a list of social media elements that we think
tutoring agencies should focus on this year. ** Educate and Inform using Video
** 2015 looks like the year that content marketing will really take off and we
don’t just mean blog posts. They way that customers consume content online is
changing and more and more people are opting to learn from video rather than
blog posts. As a tutoring agency, why not create a series of promotional
videos to help attract new students? You can use video to give tours of your
agency and to show people what a typical day in your office is like. For
teaching purposes, why not post some lessons online in video format to show
off your tutors’ expertise and increase your online presence? ** Get
Interactive on SlideShare ** SlideShare is an excellent tool that can be used
to great effect by tutoring agencies. The platform enables you to upload and
read presentations, which can be a great way of marketing your agency on
another platform. How-to presentations are particularly popular and really
shareable, so dig out those old presentations that you have lurking in your
PowerPoint folder and upload them to the platform. With the rise in
interactive online learning, SlideShare is a good tip for marketing your
agency in 2015. 

### Claim your Local Search Listing

The way in which Google
displays your business in their search engine is changing. If you haven’t
already created a Google Places page for your business then we advise you do
so this year. When people search for tutoring agencies in your area using
Google, customer reviews and star ratings will soon impact where your business
appears in the rankings. We suggest that a focus on good customer service this
year will really help encourage people to leave positive reviews about your
agency and consequently [ improve your search engine rankings

online/) . 

### Personally Interact

It’s been a long time coming but [ the
future of social media ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/social-media-strategy-
for-tutoring-businesses/) looks to be about out personalisation. Does your
agency actively share other people’s content? Or do you spend all day linking
to your own? Customers expect companies to provide them with useful content
from all over the internet, not just their own blog. They also expect
businesses to be on hand on social media to answer any questions or queries.
We suggest that in 2015, your social media strategy should include ways to
engage and start conversations with people. How do you plan to use social
media in 2015? Do you have any of the tips above on your radar? What do you
see as being the most effective social media strategy this year? We’d be
interested to hear about your experiences.
