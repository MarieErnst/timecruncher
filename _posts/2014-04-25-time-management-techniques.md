Time management is not a gift you born with, but a skill which can be acquired
and developed over time. Many students have an inadequate time management and
they can suffer from great stress. In extreme cases, this can lead to low
marks and a general feeling of failure. As many students have a part-time job
adding to their studies, it may be difficult for them to keep in mind what
they have to do. Here is a list of tips that can help your students to improve
their management skills:

* 

### Define their priorities

. It will help them avoid procrastination and save them time. 
* 

### Do a timetable

. Write down everything that needs to be done for the week. Do not hesitate to split down big projects into shorter assignments, so the work can be done gradually. 
* 

### Study every time you can

. Repetition enhances the retention of information in one's memory. 
* 

### Shut off or silent your phone

. No interruptions will occur while studying. 
* 

### Be organised

. A lack of order can be a stress factor itself for a lot of students. Remember to use sticky notes to recall important information. 
* 

### Take a break

. Students sometimes have endless work to do; however, over studying will not help them get focused and deliver good results. Experts recommend to take a break every hour in order to break up with the monotony. Suggest your students to switch from one subject to another every hour or so in order to make the most out of their effort.
