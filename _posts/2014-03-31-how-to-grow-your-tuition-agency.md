We’ve come up with a list of ways you can grow your tuition agency to keep up
with demand. The reason? There comes a point in every successful tutoring
agency’s development that growing as a business becomes an important focus.
You’ll know when that time comes as you’ll find demand for your services
increasing as your reputation grows. You might find your services booked up
weeks in advance with tutors knocking down your door to work for your agency.
In such times, it pays to plan ahead. ** Open Another Location ** As your
business grows, you may find students travelling from further afield to use
your services. In which case, consider opening a second tuition agency in
another local area. If you’re able to finance a second agency, then you’ll be
able to take advantage of all the knowledge you’ve gained from running your
first business, meaning that expansion should be a lot quicker than before. Do
some research of suitable areas to open your new venture, take note of how
many schools are nearby and what competition already exists there too. **
Become a Franchise ** Establishing your tuition agency as a franchise can be a
great way to grow your business. Becoming a franchise offers an individual the
chance to run their own business without having to worry too much about the
obstacles a start-up can face. By agreeing to a cut of profits with a
franchisee, not only will you be providing someone with the opportunity of
running their own business, you’ll benefit as well by having someone else grow
your brand. When choosing someone to run your franchise, it’s important that
both parties are clear on the terms so that everyone involved knows what to
expect from the relationship. For more information on becoming a franchise,
there’s a great post on the [ Business Insider
](http://www.businessinsider.com/franchising-tips-2011-4) website that
provides more information on the subject. ** Form an Alliance ** Perhaps a
less-risky option than franchising, forming an alliance with another tuition
agency can also be an effective way to grow your business. By agreeing to work
together in promoting one another’s agency, both companies can benefit from
the other’s success, as you’ll be associated with one another’s brand. Perhaps
you could agree to mention one another’s business in your newsletters or
advertise the other’s services on site in your premises? Displaying one
another’s posters and business cards can also help spread the word of both
businesses. If the agency that you partner with also has a good reputation
then you’ll be seen as an industry leader by association. ** Target Other
Markets ** If you feel that your agency has the potential to tap into another
market then expanding into that area could see your revenue increase. Watch
out for local business trends or identify current gaps in the market in your
local area. Perhaps you could consider expanding internally by offering
tuition in different subjects. Music tuition is a particularly popular subject
and not one that many traditional tuition agencies offer. If you have tutors
who are specialists in more obscure subjects, you could look into offering
tuition in those areas too.

approach is. Perhaps you’ve already set a plan in action for growing your
agency? How is your plan working out so far? Which strategies have you found
