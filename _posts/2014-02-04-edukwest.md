Along with [ Carfax private Tutors, ](http://www.carfax-tutors.com/en/blog) [
Tutorfair ](https://www.tutorfair.com/) and [ Maths Doctor
](http://www.mathsdoctor.co.uk/) , TutorCruncher attended the Edukwest event
focused on tutoring issues and the future of the tutoring industry. We wanted
to discuss the event and TutorCruncher’s view on new tuition agencies.

Among the topics, one burning issue caught our attention. Some of the
participants expressed their idea of turning their tuition agency into an
online tuition agency. As we are in a technology-oriented society, it can
sound tempting to set up an online business. However, when it comes to
tutoring, the TutorCruncher team is convinced that the core part of an agency
is to manage relationships between clients and tutors. As Carfax private
Tutors brilliantly highlighted during this discussion, “the tutor agency model
is here to stay and will never become obsolete”. Of course, the world of the
private tutoring industry can improve due to technology improvements. The
purpose of software is to make things easier, not entirely virtual without
risking the pedagogical skills and success.
