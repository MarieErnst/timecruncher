Finding suitable tutors for your tuition agency is one of the most important
elements of running a successful service. You want your students to receive a
quality education and this comes down to the standard of teaching they
receive. We’ve put together a checklist of points to consider when recruiting
tutors for your company.

### Safety

Parents in particular want to know that their child’s tutor has been
appropriately vetted beforehand. Every tutor you recruit should have undergone
a Disclosure and Barring Service Check (DBS) as part of the recruitment
process. From the 17th June 2013, The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and the
Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) merged together to form the
Disclosure and Barring Service which is a required background check for
specific jobs or voluntary work. 

### Qualifications

Because anyone can call
themselves a tutor, it’s a good idea to set your agency’s own minimum
qualification standards. Not every tutor needs to be a qualified tutor but the
more qualified they are, the higher the level of support they can provide.
It’s recommended that tutors are educated to at least degree level in the
subject that they specialise in. Some tuition agencies take this a step
further by only recruiting from specific top-tier universities. 

### Training

Will the tutor require any training prior to working with your tutoring
agency? It may be worthwhile observing some of their lessons in the early
stages so you can identify any areas that they may need to improve in. It’s
important that tutors know their subjects thoroughly and it’s equally
important that they keep up to date with the national curriculum and course
requirements for independent schools. As not all tutors are qualified
teachers, it’s worthwhile asking how they keep up to date with new
developments. 

### References

A tutor may have undergone a DBS check, but you
should always ask for professional references as well. Experienced tutors
should be able to provide references from students, parents and other
education professionals, showing their competencies. We recommend that a
tuition agency should follow up these references as a matter of course and
speak to the referees in person. New tutors, who have only just graduated
should still be able to provide references from university lecturers. **
Availability **

Checking a tutor’s availability during the recruitment process is also
essential. As a tutoring agency, you want piece of mind, knowing that tutors
will be flexible enough to take on last minute requests. In the lead up to
exams, tuition agencies often find themselves really busy so you’ll want to
know that you can rely on your staff to make themselves free for extra lessons
or taking on new students.
