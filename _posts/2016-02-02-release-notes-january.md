January has seen changes to help you use the system more efficiently, most notably the changes to labels for marketing.
This is paving the way for a fabulous February, which will see some great new functionality.

### Label a filter

You can now label a filtered list of users to make your searches easier to find again or send a [broadcast](http://help.tutorcruncher.com/emails/#what-is-a-broadcast) to.

​<a href="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/filtered-list.png" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="A list of tutors filtered by a certain subject" class="thumbnail">
  <img src="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/filtered-list.png" alt-text="A list of tutors filtered by a certain subject"/>
</a>

This allows you to, for instance, label and send an email to all your clients who live in London, or an email to all tutors who teach languages.

### Export by label

You can now export your users by a label applied to them, allowing you to add them to mailing lists in other marketing platforms like MailChimp.

​<a href="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/export-label.png" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Export users by their label" class="thumbnail">
  <img src="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/export-label.png" alt-text="Export users by their label"/>
</a>

### First name in emails

We've change the [email definitions](http://help.tutorcruncher.com/emails/#what-is-an-email-definition) to allow you to include just the first name of your users, creating a more personal experience for your clients and tutors.

<a href="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/recipient-first-name.png" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Create your custom email definitions within TutorCruncher" class="thumbnail">
  <img src="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/recipient-first-name.png" alt-text="Create your custom email definitions within TutorCruncher"/>
</a>

### Faster search

We've rebuilt the search function to make it faster, and now show you any filter you've applied to your tutor or client lists:

​<a href="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/filter-description.png" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="You can now see exactly what you searched for" class="thumbnail">
  <img src="{{ site.static}}/img/blogs/filter-description.png" alt-text="You can now see exactly what you searched for"/>
</a>

### Other improvements

- Extra Attributes are no longer deleted permanently, in case you accidentally delete important information!
- Gender and Date of Birth have been turned into Extra Attributes, meaning you can make them required or not.
- The Affliate's login has changed for the better, and the way they work system wide has been improved to make more sense to the users.
