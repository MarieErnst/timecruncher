</div> Students are among the most well-connected target
marketing groups. They send messages to their friends through instant
messaging services, they hear there news through social media platforms and
they pursue their interests and learning through online videos. Does your
tutoring agency have a presence in these places? We suggest following these
steps to [ creating a marketing strategy
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/digital-marketing-strategy-can-help-grow-
tuition-agency/) geared towards attracting students to your agency.

### Listen to Their Conversations

We don’t mean eavesdropping here, but it’s important that you know what
students are talking about as this can provide you with ways of connecting
with them through your marketing efforts. Education is always high on the
agenda with students so keep your ear close to the ground and follow the same
stories that they do. Perhaps you could use this information to form content
on your blog or to interact with them on social media platforms and online
forums. The more you know about students’ opinions, the better placed you’ll
be to make your agency’s brand appeal to them.

### Be Consistent in Your Communication Efforts

Part of the purpose of communicating with your target audience is to gain
their trust and one of the best ways to do this is to [ be consistent in your
communication ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/get-the-best-out-of-your-online-
communication/) . If you normally make social media posts about the latest
education news on a Monday morning then make sure you continue this and
position your brand as being reliable. Whether you tend to communicate by
email or through regular blog posts, being consistent is the key to engaging
students in conversation. Before long, they’ll interact with your posts, which
gives you the opportunity to encourage them to join your agency as a student.

Take the
Personal Approach

Students as a target marketing group are most likely to engage with brands
online and they prefer to do so in a personal manner. That means they like to
be able to communicate in their own way at their own convenience and receive
instant replies from the same person. When marketing your tutoring agency to
students, it’s important to create a two way dialogue that gives them the
opportunity to ask any questions that they have. It can also be a good idea to
encourage them to review your communication and to give feedback on their
experiences of interacting with your agency.

### Be Creative in Your Efforts

Students appreciate creative thinking and enjoy looking for new perspectives
and new ways to communicate. If you have a unique idea of how you can market
your tutoring agency to students then why not give it a go. Whether it’s a new
way of communicating online or taking a more [ guerrilla approach to marketing
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/5_core_marketing_activities_focus/) , you could
find yourself winning over a whole new audience. Image sharing websites are
particularly popular at the moment. Instagram, for example is being used more
and more by young people, which could provide the perfect opportunity for you
to show them what it’s like studying at your agency.  What’s your marketing
strategy to engage students? Which of the points above do you believe to be
the most successful when marketing your tutoring agency to students? Do you

always welcome our readers’ opinions.
