### Comment on New Developments

Private
tutoring is always in the news, which gives you the perfect opportunity to
give your opinion on the latest industry trends. By reporting on tutoring
issues, your company will come to be seen as an authority in the marketplace,
which will improve your business in general. Perhaps you strongly agree with a
change to the education system that you’d like to explore from a private
tutor’s point of view? Or maybe you disagree with an opinion expressed by
someone in the media and you’d like to create a post in response to their
comments? Reporting on new developments ensures that your business will always
be relevant and it can provide you with some great blog content too. ** Answer
Frequently Asked Questions ** Every industry has its most frequently asked
questions and the tutoring industry is no different. People new to the idea of
private tuition or interested in pursuing it as a career will have a whole
heap of questions they’d like to ask. Think about all the questions you had
when you first became a private tutor, what would you have loved to have read
about the industry then? There will always be a market for writing entry-level
blog posts about the tutoring industry, especially given its rapid growth over
the last decade. [

### Review New Technology

If you want your
tutoring agency to be on the cutting edge of education then you need to [
adapt to using new technology ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/technology-
teaching-ideas-for-private-tutors/) . Why not be the first in the industry to
review a new product that may be useful to tutoring agencies? Perhaps there’s
a new e-learning programme on the market or some new educational software?
Reviewing technology can be a great way of ensuring your blog has a steady
stream of topics to write about as the tech industry is constantly evolving
and new products are being launched every week. 

### Create ‘Best of’ Lists

Compiling your [ favourite resources in one place
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/great-tutoring-websites-and-blogs/) can form
the basis of great blog posts. Not only are these types of posts quick and
easy to write, but they also get shared more than any other blog post. If
you’ve written a ‘top ten’ or an ‘ultimate guide’ then why not alert the
companies that you’ve mentioned in the post to encourage them to share the
content with their readers? This can be a great way to build backlinks to your
website and gain exposure to new audiences. How do you come up with blog post
ideas for your tutoring agency? Do you have any topics that you find are
particularly popular? How do you ensure that your agency remains on the
cutting edge of the tutoring industry? We’d love to hear your thoughts.
