In order to improve our software and make it more user-friendly, we are
releasing new features within TutorCruncher.

Among the new characteristics, you will find a new tab for 'Classes'.

This new tab most outstanding change comprises the ability users will have to
add more than one teacher to a job. This new change makes it possible to
control and manage reports on two tutors who have been assigned to the same
pupil.

The management of the attendance or pupil reports will continue to perform in
the same way as before but it will be more user-friendly and easier for users.

TutorCruncher has never been this excellent. Try our new features and let us
know what you think about them!
