Managing a startup's image is not always about using social media to
communicate and advertise but also about dealing with problems that may hurt
the company's development.

Here is a list with the most common problems a startup might face at some
point with recommendations and solutions:



### 1\. We are not meeting the goals

 . When making a business plan your objectives must be realistic, motivational and achievable. You need to understand that at this stage, your new business has to deal with already established competitors; thus, you should not try to reach goals that surpass your capabilities. 

### 2\. The team does not get along.

 People come from different backgrounds and have their own opinions which, if they do not trust each other, they think are the right ones. As the founder or manager, you should spend time with them, making them communicate with each other and build trusting relationships. 

### 3\. My online traffic is low.

 It might happen if your startup is completely new or has been in the market for a short time. One solution involves having a link of your website on a high profile or well-ranked blog related to your activity. This way, you will be able to reach more people from your target. Also, writing blog posts daily or weekly will definitely enhance your online presence. 

### 4\. Very few people know me.

 A common problem at the beginning of an enterprise. Most usual solutions for this situation include word of mouth, online presence on social media (as discussed in Communitacion is Key), and, what might trigger clients to seek you, a blogger campaign. This last recommendation, applied to tutoring businesses, would consist of a mom/dad blogger writing about your company. 

### 5\. My clients rarely come back.

 In order to improve this situation, what you need to do is create a strong and long-lasting relationship with them. Try using social media in a fun way, delivering exciting and important information. Newsletters are also a great way of reminding your clients of your services and new promotions.
