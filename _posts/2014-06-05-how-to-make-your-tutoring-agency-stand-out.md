Establishing your tuition agency takes time. Naturally, parents and students
are inclined to use the services of an agency that have a good reputation, a
high success rate and one they can trust. However, there are a number of ways
you can speed up the growth of your agency and that’s by standing out from the
crowd. Here are a number of things you can do to set yourself apart from other
businesses in your area:

### Have a Unique Selling Point

As with any business, if you’re entering into a market that’s already competitive, you’ll need an edge to get your brand noticed. Have a think about what your tutoring agency does differently from others in your area. What makes your agency unique? Perhaps you specialise in teaching a specific subject or perhaps you focus on a particular level or age group? Maybe your agency offers tuition in a subject that no-one else offers? Whatever it is that makes your agency unique, use it as a selling point in your marketing efforts. 

### Customer Service

Nothing will spread the word about your tutoring agency better than providing great customer service. That means giving the best possible service to your students and going above and beyond to ensure that they grasp your teachings. It also means keeping parents up to date on students’ progress and answering any questions they have about their child’s education. Creating a welcoming environment in your agency also encourages people to drop by, which can create recruitment opportunities as well as send positive messages about your business. 

### Find Your Niche

The education industry is huge so don’t feel you need to pursue every avenue in order to cover your bases. One way of standing out from the crowd is to have a niche that no other tuition agency offers. For example, perhaps you specialise in prepping students for [ entry into the universities of Oxford or Cambridge ](http://www.brightyoungthings.co.uk/oxbridge-preparation/) ? Or perhaps you strongly believe in student-focused learning and adopt some teaching methods that other traditional agencies don’t? Whatever your niche, use it as one of your unique selling points 

### Get Involved

Being involved in your tutoring agency at grass roots level portrays a
positive, caring image. As an agency director, it’s important that you get to
know the students and parents who use your services. Attend local events;
introduce yourself to families and other important figures in your local area.
No-one wants to use the services of a faceless brand; people want openness and
honesty, especially when it comes to something as important as education. By
being involved in all aspects of your business, people will see your see your
agency as productive, modern and effective.
