So, your tuition agency has a website and explains all your services. You even
use social media to attract more customers. But how do you rank in search
engines? One way to improve your agency’s visibility online is to [ create a
blog ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/news-and-updates/how-to-start-a-tutoring-
business/) . It’ll help drive traffic to your site and improve your conversion
rates too. Here are our top reasons for adding a blog to your agency’s
website.

** Improves Your Website’s
Search Rankings ** By regularly posting articles on your website, you’ll be
continually optimizing your site for important keywords that relate to the
private tuition industry. By carrying out a little keyword research, you’ll
discover which terms people search for most often in the industry. You can
then craft your blog articles around these keywords, paying particular
attention to your headlines and the first 160 characters of your posts. The
more articles you publish on your site, the more chance there’ll be of people
finding your agency through Google and other search engines, which improves
your chance of converting visitors into paying customers. If your website is
based in a specific local area, make sure your keywords include local place
names to help target your audience better. ** Keeps Your Customers Up to Date
** A blog is a great way to keep your customers informed of what your agency
has been up to. It gives students and parents an opportunity to connect with
you using the comments section of your blog. [ Think of your blog as a weekly
newsletter ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/how-to-build-an-online-tutoring-
community/) where you write about your achievements, future plans the tuition
industry in general. By making regular blog posts, you’ll show people that you
take an active interest in the industry and that your agency is constantly
innovating and evolving. Remember, people are more likely to use the services
of a company they trust, and a blog is a great way to establish this.

</div> ** Shows Your Skills and
Expertise ** Before students use your tuition agency, they’ll want to know
that your company knows what it’s doing. By posting industry-related content
on your blog, you have the opportunity to show your knowledge and expertise.
Considering that you’re in the education industry, you’ll want to teach your
blog readers things they didn’t know about the industry or a particular
subject. If people feel they have already learned something from your agency
just from reading your blog, then they’ll be more likely to arrange lessons
with you. Perhaps you have a unique way of teaching a particular subject or a
strong opinion on how a particular topic should be taught? Your blog is the
perfect place to share your opinions and ideas on education. ** Helps
Establish Your Brand ** Given how competitive the private tuition industry is,
there’s a good chance that you’re not the only tutoring agency in your local
area. You can use your blog as a way of [ making your agency stand out from
the crowd ](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/how-to-make-your-tutoring-agency-
stand-out/) and establish your brand as an industry authority. How do you
differentiate your agency from your competitors? How is your image different
from other agencies? These factors can be established through the articles you
post on your website. Branding is an important part of any business and
blogging is one of the most effective ways to establish yours.
