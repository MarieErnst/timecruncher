  title:  Easy to use calendar
  text: |
    Our easy to view calendar allows you to view it by day, week or month. Filter it by contractor, client or job to
     view the right set of appointments, or colour code to, for instance, view all appointments that haven't been marked complete
     yet.
    
    You, or any of your users, can integrate TimeCruncher's calendar into their own calendars using our iCal integration.

  title:  Contractors can apply for jobs
  text: |
    If you haven't decided on which contractor to match to a client, then you can make a job 'Available for Application'. This means
     contractors can apply to work that job, and even compete on what rate they will do it for.<br><br>

    You can also send out notifications to all or some of them to ask them to apply.

  title:  Contractors log appointments and reports
  text: |
    Free up time to grow your business by allowing your contractors to log their hours instead of sending you a time sheet.<br><br>

    Reports can be created for each appointment so that when the client receives their invoice, they receive information from the
     contractor about the work that was completed. Like most of TimeCruncher, reports are customisable for recording any
     and all relevant information.

  title:  Locations
  text: |
    Use locations on appointments so that your contractors know where to go. You can use the client's address, or use your own custom locations.

  title:  Repeating Appointments
  text: |
    Appointments can repeat many times a week or month, and can last for any length. You'll save more time creating these in
     one easy step in TimeCruncher.

  title:  Upload Resources
  text: |
    Documents and other resources can be uploaded to jobs for customisable access by admins, contractors and clients.<br><br>

    A good use of this is for your contractors to upload their qualifications for the client to view, or for the client to
     download any relevant forms to fill out.

  title:  Appointment reminders
  text: |
    Clients and contractors will never forget an appointment again with our reminders, customisable for when a reminder is sent
     and who they are sent to.
