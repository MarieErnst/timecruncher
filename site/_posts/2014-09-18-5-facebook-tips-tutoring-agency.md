There are currently [1.28 billion active Facebook users worldwide](http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-
users-worldwide/) and that’s a whole lot of people your tutoring agency could
be engaging with. Whether you’re looking to sell more lessons, recruit more
students or generally increase the awareness of your tutoring agency, a
Facebook strategy can be a valuable resource. We’ve put together our 5 top
tips for using Facebook for your tutoring agency.

The trick to building your agency’s reputation on Facebook is to
focus on creating quality posts, rather than sharing any old content that can
be found on a dozen other Facebook pages. Share interesting statistics,
infographics and events that provide a unique insight into the tutoring
industry that your Facebook fans might not have seen before. You could also
try creating a regular feature like a competition or a discount that
encourages your fans to visit your page every week. You should also share
other people’s content too as this will help build your authority as a
valuable industry resource. 

### The Shorter the Better

People don’t like to
read long posts on Facebook. [The average person has 338 friends on Facebook,](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/6-new-facts-about-facebook/)
so their social feeds are constantly updating, they want short, digestible
pieces of information that they can share with their friends. Research
suggests that the most effective Facebook posts are around 60 characters in
length, so try to keep within this limit. ** Encourage Interaction Using
Images ** Perhaps you’ve just held an open day for parents and students? Why
not share some photos from the event on your page and encourage others to
comment on them? Perhaps you could run a caption competition? Reach out to
your followers and ask them to post some of their photos from the event to
your page. Not only does this improve engagement with people but it also adds
to your [social media content.](https://tutorcruncher.com/social-media-strategy-for-tutoring-businesses/) 

### Focus on Engagement Not Selling

Using
Facebook for business is all about engaging with people. Of course, you’ll
want to increase your online presence and pick up some extra business as a
result of using the platform, but to do so; you need to be more strategic. Try
to avoid hard selling or promoting your services too often. Instead, create
posts around a specific issue in the tutoring industry and ask how others go
about solving the problem. This gives you the opportunity to express your
thoughts and to encourage people to contact you for more information on how
you can help. 

### It’s All About Customer Service

A lot of your agency’s
students and tutors will turn to Facebook to ask you quick questions about
your services, so you should be ready to respond to enquiries quickly. Think
of your Facebook strategy as an extension of your customer service strategy
and try to be as helpful as possible. Make your replies friendly to show
people that your agency is approachable.
