Now that you have managed to build a great network of clients, you surely
wouldn't want to lose them. Clients should be well-considered as they reflect
the image of your business. Here are some things you might want to do to keep
your clients satisfied.

* **Ask for feedback**: send out e-mails, schedule live appointments or call your clients to know if they’re satisfied with the service you are providing. 

* Invite your clients to networking events in order to keep good relationships with them.  It’s also vital as you might get in touch with prospective clients since your existing clients are satisfied of your services and spread the word around them. 
* Keep the follow-up e-mail **short** and **simple**.

* **Make it personal**: show you know them and their needs. 
If they subscribed to a social network ( [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) , [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) ), get aware
of what they are doing or what is going on with their business. Let them know
that you care about the success of their business by re-tweeting their content
and tweeting them too..  

* **Try to be as available as possible.** If you reply quickly clients will feel reassured especially if a problem comes up.
