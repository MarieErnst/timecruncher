Although not the world’s oldest professions, tutoring has to be somewhere close. Since antiquity, young people have been taught and mentored by tutors, whether it be Aristotle tutoring Alexander the great or John Skelton tutoring the young Henry VIII. But as we enter the digital age, the personal relationship between tutor and student that has always been so important is decreasing in importance.

The tutoring market in Hong Kong might offer a vision of the future. It has been mentioned on these pages that tutoring is becoming almost ubiquitous in the UK, but in Hong Kong tutoring has been taken to another level. Exam performance is so important that star tutors become mini-celebrities, their faces appearing on billboards on the subway  and tv ads and earn literally millions of dollars a year as parents clamour to get their children into their classes.

Snapask was launched in Hong Kong three years ago and allows pupils to ask questions on their mobile phone or smartphones and be matched in seconds for one-to-one sessions with one of their thousands of instructors. It is the Uber service of tutoring, convenient, app-based, and with the potential to connect much more diverse questions and teaching specialisms across a wide area. [Online tools](/features/), rather than one-to-one face-to-face tutoring, are clearly the future and no one wants to become the black cab of the tutoring world. That’s why [TutorCruncher](/) has been working on integrating online teaching platforms to help your agency keep with the time. Watch this space for a full announcement soon.
