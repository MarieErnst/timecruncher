TutorCruncher is about to release its most substantial update within the next
2 days. New Features: 

### Balance and Available Balance

* The balance and available balance features work in a very similar way to most online banking systems. 
* The balance feature tracks a clients actual balance, i.e. the balance tracks all paid invoices and administration charges and the total of any prepayments a client has made. 
* The available balance gives the administrator a live update of the outstanding balance i.e. the total of all prepayments minus all outstanding lessons and administration charges. 
* The difference between the two balances shows the total outstanding amount for the client in TutorCruncher. 
* The new UserBalance option when paying an invoice allows the administrator to pay the invoice with the Clients balance and not log a new payment in the system. It is ideal if your business runs a pre-payment system. 
* ‘Outstanding balance’ is the tutors equivalent of the clients balance feature, which displays the total outstanding monies due to the tutor calculated from all lessons logged in the system. 

### Balance feature workflow examples.

Basic Post-Pay 

* A client opens an account. The balance and available balance equal £0.00. 
* A £50 administration charge and a £50 lesson are logged. Available balance drops to £-100.00, balance stays at £0.00. (At this point the administrator and client can easily see the full outstanding amount due to payments logged in TutorCruncher) 
* Invoice generated. 
* Client pays £100, invoice is marked as paid, Available balance rises up to £0.00. 
Basic Pre-Pay

* A client opens an account with a £1000 credit. 
* A £50 administration charge and a £50 lesson are logged. Available balance drops to £900.00, balance stays at £1000. (At this point the administrator and client can easily see there has been £100 of charges made but they have not been finalised in the system) 
* Invoice generated. 
* Administrator marks the invoice is marked as paid using the UserBalance feature, which does not create a payment history but uses the clients balance to pay the invoice. 
* Available balance stays at £900 and Balance drops to £900 
Crediting an Invoice

* There are many ways you can complete the crediting of an invoice. 
* If the invoice has not been generated all lessons and charges can be edited. 
* If an invoice has been generated but unpaid and an item is incorrect there are two options. The invoice is deleted and the administrator edits the incorrect item and re-issues the invoice. The available balance will take the change into account. The balance will adjust down to the available balance amount when the new invoice is marked as paid. 
* The second option, if the full amount is incorrect, is to use the credit function, this will re-adjust the available balance and change the outstanding amount on the invoice accordingly. 
* If an invoice has been paid there are now two ways to amend the issue, one option would be to refund the client outside the system. The other option is to offer a top-up within the system, the clients balance increases and the extra credit can be used against future lessons. 

### Commission Sharing.

* Commission sharing allows the agency to split their commission with another agency/tutor/client who recommends a new client. 
* The percentage split is set on the tutors profile. If a client or an agency recommends a client, a basic tutor profile can be created for the client or agency to record the split of commission. 

### Schedule.

* The ‘schedule’ documents all your lessons in a handy calendar format. 
* Lessons by a specific tutor or client can be found using the search tool. 
* Lessons can be moved through the ‘drag and drop’ feature. 

### Other Features:

* Ability to not bill a job through the invoicing and billing platform 
* Many other bug fixes and minor improvements.
