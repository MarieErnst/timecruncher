Arguing that 

### computer and video games

are extremely useful tools to
stimulate learning processes may still be considered hazardous. But new
learners, grown up with technology at their fingertips, are deeply different
from those from the past.

Several studies has proved that digital natives are more adaptive, better at
parallel processing, quicker in taking and retaining information and more
comfortable in collaborating over network. This is why, especially for new
learners, educational computer games are more engaging and motivating 
learning environments
than traditional classes.

### What is Digital Game-Based Learning

According to [Learn NC](http://www.learnnc.org/lp/pages/4970) , Digital
Game-Based Learning (DGBL) can be defined as “an instructional method that
incorporates educational content or learning principles into video games with
the goal of engaging learners.”

Such games are specifically designed to balance subject matter with gameplay,
offering a new type of experiential learning based on the ability of students
to sink in and apply their knowledge to situations that simulate the real
world.

are able to grab the attention of the learner and, at the same time, provide them with the tools for understanding the consequences of their actions. 

When dived into an effective game-based learning environment, students are
free to make mistakes without risks and learn the right way to do things
through experimentation and practice, an article from [Ed Tech Review](http://edtechreview.in/dictionary/298-what-is-game-based-learning) says.

Furthermore, thought processes enabled by this kind of learning experience can
be easily transferred from the simulated environment to real life.

### Use of Digital Games in the Classrooms

Those mentioned above are just the potential application of digital games in
education, but how are teachers responding to this revolution?

[According to](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/06/teachers_turn_to_each_other_to.html) [a survey](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/06/teachers_turn_to_each_other_to.html) produced by Joan
Ganz Cooney Center, a nonprofit research organization that studies children's
learning and digital media, teachers are making frequent use of educational
computer games in their classrooms, in order to better engage their students.
With the help of the infographic below, we’ve tried to summarize some of the
key findings of the research.
