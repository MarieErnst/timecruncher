## Content 

* Write relevant content – Your readers seek information about your business and the services you can provide. 
* Put conclusions at the beginning - Get to the point in the first paragraph. 
* Write only one idea per paragraph – Be concise. People do not read webpages, they scan them. 
* Use action words – Tell your readers what to do, avoiding the passive voice. 
* Keep the flow of your pages moving. 

## Format 

* Use lists instead of paragraphs – Lists are easier to scan than paragraphs. 
* Keep your lists short (7-10 things at a time). By keeping your list items short , it helps your reader remember them. 
* Write short sentences – Use only the words you need to get the essential information across. 
* Include internal sub-headings – Makes it more readable. 
* Make your links part of the content – Readers scan pages for links, because they stand out from normal text and provide cues as to what the page is aboutscannable. 

## Proofread your work 

* Typos and spelling errors will send people away from your pages 

## Images and text - Receiving your message 

When using a

, the message is better caught by your
readers. A good idea would be to use pictures of you teaching your students.
Also, try using infographics and other images. Control your message better by

### writing

what you want to communicate. By using image and text in a
message you catch attention visually and give maximum understanding. Once you
have intuitive interest and trust, the reader may start reading. Now you can
be specific about your message.

## The AIDA model 

AIDA is a traditional model that gives you a general understanding of how to
target a market effectively. 

### A

ttention – attract the attention of the
customer. 

### I

nterest – raise customer interest by demonstrating and
focusing on advantages and benefits of your tutoring business. 

### D

esire –
convince your customers that they want and desire your service, and that it
will satisfy their needs. 

### A

ction – lead customers towards taking action
and order a class with your tutors.

## Trust 

Parents need to believe in you and that your tutor team will be the best for
their children.

* Honesty 
* Competence 
* Kindness to your audience and empathy 
* Experience 
* Commitment 
* Perseverance 
* Co-branding - E.g. “We cooperate with experts” 
These things make the customer trust you and your company.

## Unique Selling Propositions 

The Unique Selling Propositions is a great way to sell your service. Most
businesses come up with their own slogans and USPs. The USP will give
customers a feeling of what you can provide for their children.

1. Must be unique – either a uniqueness of the brand or a claim not otherwise made in that particular market 
2. So strong that it can pull in new customers to your tuition services 

### Examples of USPs

* M&Ms – _ The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand _ This is an example of how even a rather off-beat USP can be catchy and compelling. Who would think of making a selling point from fact that your product doesn't melt? M&Ms did, and it worked very well for them! 
* Avis – _ We’re number two. We try harder _ This USP does a fantastic job of turning a drawback into a benefit. For a long time, Avis was the second-largest car rental company, after Hertz. In fact, Avis was struggling just to stay afloat. As part of a total image makeover, Avis hired the famous ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach to come up with a new ad campaign. The campaign was so successful, Avis' market share went from 11% to 35% in just four years. 
* FedEX Corporation – When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight  FedEx no longer uses this slogan, but while it lasted it was a perfect example of a compelling USP. In a few words, FedEx guarantees that it will deliver your package safely and on time. FedEx replaced it with the slogan, “ _ The World on Time _ ,” which is vague and doesn't contain a USP. 

## Most Wanted Response 

MWR is the action that you wish the visitor to do - Typically the action that
generates the most value for your business. Have a clear MWR for each and
every page of your website and then only include the content that moves
visitors towards your MWR and strip away anything that doesn't.
