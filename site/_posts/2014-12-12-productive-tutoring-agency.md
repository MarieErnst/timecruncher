</div> ** ** Keep Track of Goals
and Targets ** When you’re involved in the day to day running of a tutoring
agency, it can be easy to lose track of the bigger picture. It’s important to
make sure that you’re keeping to the original plan you set out in your [
business strategy](https://tutorcruncher.com/5_core_marketing_activities_focus/) and aren’t
being distracted by other fruitless avenues. By comparing your progress to
your initial predictions, you’ll be able to see if any of your business
operations need adjusted in order to stay on track and move forward. If you
see that something isn’t working, take it back to basics or try an alternative
approach. 

### Hire a Second Pair of Eyes

Sometimes there just aren’t enough
hours in the day and with all the responsibilities that go with being a [ tutoring agency owner](https://tutorcruncher.com/what-makes-a-good-tuition-agency-director/) , you can’t afford not to spend your days
productively. One of the best moves you can make to lighten your load is to
hire a second pair of eyes. Appointing an assistant manager can help ensure
your focus remains on the tasks at hand while they take care of other aspects
of the business. If you have a motivated workforce, you won’t be short of
staff willing to step up the career ladder. 

### Use Email Sparingly

Other
than social media, [checking emails](https://tutorcruncher.com/email-marketing-mistakes/) is one of the most distracting aspects of running a
business. It can be tempting to keep your inbox open all day and deal with
emails as they come in, but this could be doing your productivity more harm
than good. Although being able to multitask is a useful skill, in order to
complete a task effectively, you need to give it your full concentration and
checking your email every 10 minutes only takes away from the task at hand.
Try checking your email at certain times every day so you get into a routine.

### Focus on ROI

One of the best ways to ensure your productivity is to ask
yourself why you’re doing each task. If your answer is because it’ll grow your
business in the long term, then great, but if your answer deviates from this
at all, they task may not be worthwhile. Every business owner needs to
consider their return on investment and weigh up which bridges to cross and
which to burn. If you’re unsure about whether you should be spending your time
on a task or not, delegate it to someone else, then you’ll feel better knowing
that it’s being covered. Do you ever find yourself in a slump at work? How do
you ensure you stay productive? Which of the points above do you believe is
the most effective? Do you have any of your own points that you’d like to add?
