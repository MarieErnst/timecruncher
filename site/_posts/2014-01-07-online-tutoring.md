You may want to expand your tutoring services by offering online tuition. This
may be an area of growth for existing and prospective tutors. [Online tutoring](https://tutorhub.com/) can be lower cost since all that is required
is an internet connection and a webcam.  There are several options based on
the tutor and client needs, [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/) and [
Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) are popular options
which offer video. If a whiteboard is required [IDroo](http://idroo.com/),
[Scribblar](http://www.scribblar.com/) and [GroupBoard](http://www.groupboard.com/products/) can be used alongside them. Documents
such as worksheets or presentations can also be shared via [GoogleDocs](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html) so that students can keep and revisit
resources.

Adding online tutoring to your business repertoire means there is greater
scope to work with a larger network of clients and tutors, increase revenue
and make resources available online. Since travel is not necessary you may
agree with tutors to charge less for online tutoring sessions.

Even with online tutoring it would be important to speak to your tutors to
ensure that they are providing the service you expect.
