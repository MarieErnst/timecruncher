### 8\. Break down your revenue streams

* Pricing structure 
* Costs 
* Margins Expenses 
Revenue prediction in real terms can actually be detrimental to your plan (as
it often does not meet expectations) – but knowing what makes up your revenue
is valuable. ** 9\. Budget how much money you need to get started – and keep
going **

* Funding your idea can come from friends, family and/or personal funds 
* SBA loans and bank financing are options for modest growth businesses 
* Angel investors and venture capitalists will fund rapid growth opportunities

### 10\. Create a plan for breaking even

* Revenue can be tough to predict. Thus, create a few different scenarios to be able to cope with non-predicted situations! 
* If possible, break it down month-by-month for your business’ first two years 
* Create contingencies for positive and negative scenarios 
* If  you see unexpected success, your goals may be pushed up significantly – and suddenly you need a new plan - if you hit a rough patch and you don’t have a plan, your business could slump or even fail
