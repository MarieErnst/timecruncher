When applying to grammar schools, parents need to take into account that even
if their child has qualified in the 11+ tests they might still not get in.
This is due to the schools' Admissions Policy.No matter what, admission
authorities are obliged to admit two types of children ahead of others:

1. Those in care of the Local Authority. 
2. Those with a Statement of Special Needs. 
Once those children have been allocated, other rules may applied. The
following are in the order specified by the Admission Policy.

* 

### Catchment

. A particular area around the school is given priority. 
* 

### Distance

. This is measure from home to the main entrance of the school. 
* 

### Sibling priority

. Children with an older brother or sister will be given priority. 
* 

### Score

. Places will be filled from the highest score downwards. 
* 

### Tie-breaker

. Elements from the test will be used to decide between two equal applications. 
* 

### Religious commitment

. 
* 

### Exceptional medical, educational or social reasons.

* 

### Aptitude

. Places at certain schools for children with academic, musical or sporting talent. 
* 

### Random Allocation

. This criterion is also used as a tie-breaker.
