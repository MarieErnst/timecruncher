Digital technology may be the future of marketing but when it comes to private
tutoring, word of mouth remains the lifeblood of the industry. Here are our
top tips on how you can [grow your tutoring business](https://tutorcruncher.com/how-to-make-your-tutoring-agency-stand-out/) by
spreading the word throughout your local community. ** Have a Strong Local
Presence ** In order to get people talking about your tutoring business, you
need to put yourself out there and mingle with other businesses and the local
community. Keep up to date with local events and look for opportunities to
spread the word about your tutoring agency. Perhaps you can sign up as an
exhibitor at a business networking event or act as a sponsor of an educational
conference? The more involved you become in your [local community](https://tutorcruncher.com/local-seo-marketing-your-tuition-agency-online/), 
the more people will recognise your brand and start talking about
your services. 

### Pay Extra Special Attention to your Customer Service

There’s no better form of marketing in the tutoring industry than a positive
review from an existing student or parent. Remember, students are one of the
most influential marketing groups out there, so if you do a good job and help
them achieve their goals; they won’t be long in singing your praises to their
peers. When it comes to customer service, it’s the little things that count.
Make sure that your tutors are providing a tailored, personalized service to
each of their students and ensure they make themselves available to help
students out with their lesson times. Going the extra mile is what leaves
people with a good impression of your business overall. ** Don’t be Afraid to
Ask for Referrals ** If you receive positive feedback about your services,
don’t be afraid to encourage people to tell their friends about your business.
Hand out your business cards to existing students and ask them to pass them on
to anyone they think would be interested in using your agency. You could also
consider setting up a ‘refer a friend’ scheme, where you offer discounts to
students on their lessons if they introduce someone new to your business.
Other businesses in your community can also be a good source of referrals. Why
not approach some companies who may be able to provide you with new customers
and ask if you can take out some advertising space in their newsletter? ** **

### Create a Buzz Around Your Business

Carefully thought out PR can be a
great way to get people talking about your business. Perhaps your tutoring
agency has had a record year of students achieving A’s in their exams? Or
maybe you’ve recently recruited a new employee with an impressive track
record? These achievements make for great local news stories and can really
help boost awareness of your brand in your local area. Before [pitching a story idea](https://tutorcruncher.com/marketing-via-print-and-online/) to
a newspaper or magazine, make an effort to build up a relationship with them
first so that they get to know a bit more about what you do and what your
investment in the local community is. _ What do you find to be the best ways
