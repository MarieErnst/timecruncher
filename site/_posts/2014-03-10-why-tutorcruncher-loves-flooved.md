### [Flooved.com](http://www.flooved.com/) looks to shake up the educational system and publishing industry with its subscription streaming model.

It is a universal truth that education is not equally reachable for all students. 
This situation motivated Nicolas Philippe and Hamish Brocklebank to go for a change and create Flooved, a startup is based on 
the notion of sharing as well as social collaboration. On this platform students across the world can have access to free and 
high quality knowledge. Professors from all over the world can submit their textbooks to this platform, which is for now mainly 
focused on Physics and Maths. TutorCruncher recommends [Flooved](http://www.flooved.com/) not only because it provides students 
with accurate content, but also because it presents helpful features and aims to implement new ones. These include annotations, 
group sessions, a platform for questions and answers, mobile and tablet versions and many more. For this reason 
[Flooved](http://www.flooved.com/) has been highly awarded and featured in different media. It challenges 
the current order by creating a platform for public sharing and, most importantly it aims to be free for good.
