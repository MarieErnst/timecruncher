People like stories. They want to be able to put a face to your brand-name.
The “About Us” section on your website can be a very powerful means of
persuading your clients that you are the right tutoring business for them. If
memorable it will separate you from other generic tutoring businesses and make
your agency stand out from the crowd. Most importantly it will establish
trust.

The story of your brand needs to be convincing. It should serve to strengthen
your business and be the means by which you can connect with your customers
about what is most meaningful to them. You only have to think about 
[Richard Branson](http://www.brand-journalism.co.uk/sample-page/section-3-brand-journalism-storytelling-paths/chapter-24-establishing-a-personal-brand-how-richard-branson-has-built-his-personal-brand/) 
to appreciate the power of
connecting clients to your brand story.

In the case of a tutoring business you will want to demonstrate that your
company exists to help students and that your tutors have a tailored approach
to each individual. Or something that demonstrates your empathic approach to
learning. These will be aligned with your business values.

You will also want to illustrate how your brand was forged. For example,
“After graduating from Durham University with a Masters in History,
Christopher realised the very real need for a progressive, young and dynamic
tutoring agency in the areas surrounding London”. This example suggests that
Christopher has created a different tutoring agency and the client will be
intrigued as to what makes his company “progressive” and “dynamic”, whilst
appreciating that “young” tutors will relate children in a way that older
tutors cannot. The client will also subconsciously admire the fact that
Christopher has identified a gap in the market in the areas outside of London.
This is the foundation of a good brand story as it shows willingness to
experiment.

Obviously you need more than the foundation but this will come from your own
unique insights and experience. When people come in contact with your brand
they need to believe that they can trust it, and more importantly, that they
can trust you with their children.

Connect with your clients and make them have faith in you.
