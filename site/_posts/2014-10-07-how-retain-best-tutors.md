A recent survey by Monster Jobs, found that [ 70% of people
](http://www.about-monster.com/content/monster-poll-reveals-motivating-power-
vacation-start-job-search) are more likely to look for a new job after a
holiday period. So, with the summer holidays now over and Christmas just
around the corner, how can you ensure that your agency retains its staff?
We’ve put together a list of ways you can help improve your tutors’ loyalty.

### Give Your Tutor’s Ownership

Giving your staff more responsibility is a great way to show how much you
value the work that they do. The most ambitious of your tutors will want to
increase their experience beyond giving lessons every day and if you can help
them realise their ambitions internally, you’ll help ensure that they stay
with your agency. Perhaps there’s a new project that your agency intends to
launch that someone in your team could help with? Or perhaps there’s an
opening for another management position within the agency that you know would
be perfect for one of your tutors?

### Create an Open Culture

[ Private tutoring is all about communication
](http://www.tutorcruncher.com/communication-is-key/) , not only between
students and tutors but also between an agency and its staff. It’s important
that you keep your tutors up to date with the latest happenings within the
business and encourage people to ask questions and share ideas. A mistrust of
management is one the main reasons people look for jobs elsewhere, so be open
and honest about where the agency is at the moment and what its future plans
are. If your tutors see potential opportunities opening up in the future,
they’ll be more likely to stay with your company. 

### Share Your Mission

What was it that inspired you to [ start a tutoring agency

business/) in the first place? Whatever your reason, telling your tutors your
start-up story can he

them on board with what you’re trying to achieve. If your staff feel that
they’re a part of something bigger and are making a difference with the work
that they do, they’ll be more likely to continue working for your agency over
the long-term. Encourage your staff to adopt your agency’s values and arrange
regular sessions where people can reflect on their achievements over the last
few months. 

### Ask for Feedback

Giving your employees the opportunity to
say what’s on their mind can help inspire trust. Asking for anonymous feedback
can be a great way to gather the thoughts and feelings of your staff and can
help identify any problems or issues within the team. This gives you the
opportunity to show that you value your staff’s opinions by taking action on
any issues that come up and by answering any questions. Do you find that your
tutors tend to move on after a holiday period? How do you plan to retain your
tutors in the future? Do you have any advice you’d like to share with our
