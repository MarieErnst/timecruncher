#### **5. How we keep strengthening our position in the future?**
3 years is a short time in business terms. The market needs to notice a business and in this time
period you need to set everything on point regarding, [management](/features/scheduling/), 
research and development (R&D), sales, [accounting](/features/accounting/), [profit](/features/analytics/), government 
support, target audience, partners ect.
You need to be sure about the goals you wish to achieve when the company gets to a position where it is profitable.
The best way to strengthening your business is by keep innovating!

#### **6. How we expand our market share?**

#### **7. How can we increase our profit margins in our existing or new clientele?**
Most of the people who think about starting a business start with the [financial](/features/accounting/) 
part. This is not a good approach. In fact you can only do this after you have a good idea of the market 
and your product. In this way you will make better decisions what eventually will make your business stronger.
 Give the customers more than one choice for a single product; by adding extra features to the same product 
 you can ask a better price. A great example is the mobile industry - people how want the top line of your product 
 will be prepared to pay for it.

#### **8. What actions we can take to improve after this?**
You can improve other parts of the business to find areas - you may find areas of the business that can provide unexpected profits!
This can range from services, production and partners, to financials and vertical integration. 
[Analysing your companies data](/features/analytics/) will help you figure out whats needs to 
be done. Some of them are long term actions, other you can do more easily. It is up to you what you want to do 
on short and long term.
