### What is VAT?

VAT is a tax that is charged on most business transactions in the UK. Businesses add VAT to the price they charge when they provide goods or services to: 

* Business customers – for example when you have a tuition business you will add VAT to your prices, when you charge a client for a lesson. 
If you’re a VAT-registered business, in most cases you:

* Charge VAT on the services you provide 
* Reclaim the VAT you pay when you buy goods and services for your tuition business 
If you’re not VAT-registered then you cannot reclaim the VAT you pay at these
occasions.  

### When must you register for VAT?

If you're a business and the
goods or services you provide count as what's known as 'taxable supplies',
you'll have to register for VAT if either:

* Your turnover for the previous 12 months has gone over a specific limit called the ‘VAT threshold’, which is currently £83,000 
* You think your turnover will soon go over this limit 
You can choose to register for VAT if you want, even if you don’t have to pay
yet  Follow this link to find out more about how and when to register for VAT:
[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/start/register/index.htm](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/start/register/index.htm) ** How VAT is charged
and accounted for? ** If you’re VAT-registered the VAT you add to the sale
price of your tutoring goods or services are called your 'output tax'. The VAT
you pay when you buy goods and services for your business are called your
'input tax'.  

### Filling in your VAT Return

If you're VAT-registered you'll
have to submit a VAT Return at regular intervals - usually quarterly - the
return shows:

* The VAT you've charged on your sales to your customers in the period - known as output tax 
* The VAT you've paid on your purchases - known as input tax 
If the amount of output tax is more than the input tax, then you send the
difference to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) with your return.  If the input tax
is more than your output tax, you claim the difference back from HMRC.  There
are special schemes that some businesses can use to help them work out and pay
their VAT.  

### Rates of VAT

There are different VAT rates, depending on the
goods or services that are being provided. Currently there are three rates:

* Standard rate 20 per cent 
* Reduced rate 5 per cent 
* Zero rate 0 per cent 
The standard rate of VAT is the default rate - this is the rate that's charged
on most goods and services in the UK unless they're specifically identified as
being reduced or zero-rated.  

### How to pay VAT

This guide gives you the
payment deadlines for VAT and tells you about your payment options.  It is now
mandatory to send HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) your VAT Return online and pay
any VAT electronically. HMRC recommends that you pay by Direct Debit.  If the
VAT you owe HMRC is less than £1, you don't need to pay anything or to carry
the amount forward.  

### VAT payment deadlines

You are responsible for
calculating how much VAT you owe and for paying your VAT on time. Your payment
must reach HMRC's bank account no later than the due date shown on your VAT
Return. If you miss the payment deadline you may have to pay a surcharge for
late payment.  

### Use the right payment reference

When you pay HMRC it is
important to use the right reference number. This makes sure your payment
reaches your account and you won't get reminders after you've paid.  To pay
your VAT you use your 9 digit VAT registration number. For example,123 4567
89. You can find your reference number:

* In your VAT online account 
* On your VAT Registration Certificate 
When you give your VAT registration number please shows the reference without
any gaps between the characters, for example 123456789, or there could be
delays in updating your account.  If your payment does not reach HMRC's bank
account by the due date, you may have to pay a surcharge for late payment.
