When the time comes that you have to turn students down because you don’t have
any spaces left, you only have 

### three

options:

1. You gracefully turn students away and don’t hear from them again 

2. You pass them details of other tutors who operate in your area 

3. You set up a business model where you earn a commission on every lesson you organize between st  udents and other tutors 

The third option is certainly the one with most to offer you in terms of
financial reward. Without really being aware of it, you may have already
implemented an agency business model into your tutoring by passing on details
of other tutors to students. In this case, all you need to do is arrange the
legal side of things and start charging for the service.

There’s a Financial Safety Net in Place 

If all your tutoring efforts have paid off and you have enough money put away
to fund a start-up business then this could be the perfect time to start your
own agency. Having your own source of income to fund your venture will save
you having to borrow money and take out loans,  which is a more financially
secure option in the long term. Remember, setting up a tutoring agency doesn’t
have to cost a fortune, many new agencies start by operating out of their own
home and existing virtually.

Your Students are Achieving Their Goals

your students are consistently achieving the grades they hoped for, then you
know that you’re doing your job well. Having confidence in your own ability
can often act  as the catalyst for starting new business ventures. If you
already have a good reputation in your local area, then starting  a tutoring
ag  ency could be a logical next step.  You’ll be able to launch your business
on the back of your previous success a  s a sole trader.

If you’re one of those tutors who is constantly being asked for advice by
other tutors, then you might want to consider yourself a leading figure. If
people  value your thoughts and opinions on education, then you’ll be in a
strong position to grow your business to the next stage.

leap from sole trader to limited company? Perhaps you’re a sole trader at the
moment. How do you think you’ll know when the time is right to start an
