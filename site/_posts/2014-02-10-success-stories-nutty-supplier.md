To be a supply teacher has its ups and downs. When starting her career as a
supply teacher, there was little information about the job. Sharon started the
website Supplybag.co.uk as a hobby, but it became clear that there was a need
for the information that she could provide and it is highly popular today  In
this interview she discusses her experiences, what she has learnt and mistakes
she overcame.  

### What got you started in this industry?

I was a teacher
for many years before choosing to do supply work. I started my forum for
supply teachers after just a couple of years' supply teaching, as I found it a
quite isolating career move, and guessed that there would be many other supply
teachers feeling the same way. Very quickly I realised that supply teachers
didn't have many places to turn to when they were looking for information, so
I decided to help. 

### Did you always want to own your own business?

Not at
all! I'd always wanted to be a teacher, although my first degree was in
European Business Administration as I'd always found the workplace
fascinating. It has been a very natural progression into owning my own
business. [SupplyBag.co.uk](http://supplybag.co.uk/) was my hobby first.
When I became ill with Palindromic Rheumatoid Arthritis and could no longer
work as a supply teacher, it was an easy decision to really try and make a go
of the website as an income generator. I now love it, I really enjoy being my
own boss, though I know I'm not hard enough on myself! 

### How did you grow

? When I first started the website, it was quite a niche market. Supply
teacher agencies were about, but not in the same numbers as today as most
supply teachers could still work through their local authority directly.
Visitor numbers to the website from the off were quite high. I have taken a
step sideways for growth, and launched what could be seen as a rival website!
I always saw [SupplyBag.co.uk](http://supplybag.co.uk/) as a complete works,
holding all the information someone new to supply teaching would need. So I
took a step sideways, and launched another website, TheSupplyTeacher.com, that
contains nothing they need, but everything they may want. It's a bi-monthly
e-zine, and it means I can add fresh content, interviews etc., and host events
like National Supply Teacher Week and Supply for Lunch. I've also created
e-books from the most popular pages of [SupplyBag.co.uk](http://supplybag.co.uk/) , which I now sell. These e-books have proved so
popular that I now try and launch a new e-book for supply teachers each term.

### What mistakes did you make?

Thinking that once a website is launched,
people will automatically go and look for it, and find it! It is very easy to
make a website these days. The hard part is getting good quality traffic. I
work a 40hr week, and I would say a good 70% is on traffic generation, even
though [SupplyBag.co.uk](http://supplybag.co.uk/) is over 8 years old. It is
a continual process, and I learn some new SEO technique every week. ** What
was the biggest thing you learnt? ** That I *can* do this. I believe self-
doubt is the biggest barrier to success. I still suffer with it frequently,
but I'm getting better at coming out fighting. I have realised that it is
often set off by external influences, which I have no control over. However,
how I react to them is something I am learning to control. ** What advice
would you give to new startup 

### ** s?

Give it a go! Do not however, plough
your life savings into it. It cost me nothing but time to set up my forum, and
my business has grown from there, organically. What is the future of Supply
Bag? [SupplyBag.co.uk](http://supplybag.co.uk/) I believe will continue
to be an essential resource for supply teachers. However, I do see
TheSupplyTeacher.com becoming as important as time goes on. With the launch
and hosting of National Supply Teacher Week and Supply for Lunch, both
championing supply teachers, the superheroes of education, I am gaining more
and more visitors and contacts interested in helping me to build a supportive
and celebratory community for supply teachers.
