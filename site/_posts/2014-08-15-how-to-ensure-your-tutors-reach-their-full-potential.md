As a tutoring agency directory, you’ll want to enable your tutors to reach
their full potential and [inspire their students](https://tutorcruncher.com/advice-for-tutors-how-to-inspire-learning/) to
do their best. As a private tutor yourself, you may find it challenging to let
your tutors find their own way in your agency but allowing them the space to
discover their own strengths will ensure they tutor to the best of their
ability. 

### Know Their Skills

Every tutor has a different educational
background and so has a different skillset. As an agency directory, it’s your
job to get to know your tutors and understand where their strengths lie. Your
tutors should be able to [teach to their strengths](https://tutorcruncher.com/improving-your-tuition-skills/) using
techniques and methods that they find works best for their students. Although
having teaching guidelines in place can help steer the structure of lessons,
giving tutors a certain amount of free reign in how they approach lessons will
ensure they reach their full potential and get the best out of their students.

### Empower Your Tutors

Tutors who feel appreciated at work and are given
praise where it’s due, perform better. Sometimes all it takes to ensure your
tutors perform to their best ability is some encouragement and confirmation
that what they’re already doing is working well. If there are any aspects of
the job that a tutor appears to be struggling with, equip them with the tools
they need to improve their skills. This can be done through providing
training, mentoring or arranging shadowing sessions with other tutors. ** Let
Them Succeed in Their Own Way ** Sometimes, it’s best to leave your staff to
their own devices to ensure they teach to their best. You may find that many
of your tutors are self-motivators and are able to organise their own
workloads and [manage their time effectively](https://tutorcruncher.com/time-management-techniques/) without too much
direction. If your tutors appear to be succeeding on their own, perhaps all
you need to do as a director is let them know that you’re there for support
should they need it. Giving your tutors space to discover their own style and
what works best for their students can itself, be empowering to staff. **
Allow Them to Lead ** Giving your tutors the opportunity to show their
initiative and take a leading role in arranging lessons and managing their
student’s schedules can help ensure that your staff reach their full
potential. Some people are natural leaders and will want to take on more
responsibility within your agency. In such cases, this ambition should be
encouraged, as having strong leaders is important within a company. It can
also give you, as a director, the opportunity to delegate certain tasks to
ease up your workload.

In what ways do you
ensure that your tutors reach their full potential? Do you use any of the
methods listed above? What do you do to empower your staff? And how do you
recognize those who are natural leaders? We’d love to hear of any tips you
might have to help other tutoring agency directors.
