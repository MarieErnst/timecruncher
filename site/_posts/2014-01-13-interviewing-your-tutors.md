As you build your database of tutors you need some key information about their
capacity and availability. Here are some key questions you should consider
asking them:What subjects can you teach?

To which [level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean) ? How far are you willing to travel? When are you available to tutor?
Are you able to travel or will you tutor from home? Do you have [DBS](https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview) clearance?
What tutoring experience do you have? What teaching experience do you have?
What kinds of resources do you have? How would you describe your teaching
style? Any other questions worth asking ?
