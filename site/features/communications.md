## Send Customised Automated Emails

TimeCruncher can send emails for almost anything, such as appointment reminders, sending invoices or just welcoming a new
 client. Often this is the only time you have contact with a client, so we've made sure you can customise all emails within
 TimeCruncher with your own content and logo. You can even write your own HTML templates.

Our integrated mail service allows you to send emails from your own address - your clients can reply straight to your
 inbox.
