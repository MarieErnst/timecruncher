## Easy to use calendar

Our easy to view calendar allows you to view it by day, week or month. Filter it by contractor, client or job to
 view the right set of appointments, or colour code to, for instance, view all appointments that haven't been marked complete
 yet.

You, or any of your users, can integrate TimeCruncher's calendar into their own calendars using our iCal integration.

## Contractors can apply for jobs

If you haven't decided on which contractor to match to a client, then you can make a job 'Available for Application'. This means
contractors can apply to work that job, and even compete on what rate they will do it for.

You can also send out notifications to all or some of them to ask them to apply.

## Contractors log appointments and reports

Free up time to grow your business by allowing your contractors to log their hours instead of sending you a time sheet.

Reports can be created for each appointment so that when the client receives their invoice, they receive information from the
 contractor about the work that was completed. Like most of TimeCruncher, reports are customisable for recording any
 and all relevant information.

## Repeating Appointments

Appointments can repeat many times a week or month, and can last for any length. You'll save more time creating these in
one easy step in TimeCruncher.

## Upload Resources

Documents and other resources can be uploaded to jobs for customisable access by admins, contractors and clients.

A good use of this is for your contractors to upload their qualifications for the client to view, or for the client to
download any relevant forms to fill out.

## Appointment reminders

Clients and contractors will never forget an appointment again with our reminders, customisable for when a reminder is sent
 and who they are sent to.

## Locations

Use locations on appointments so that your contractors know where to go. You can use the client's address, or use your own custom locations.
