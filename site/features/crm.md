All of your users, be they clients, students or contractors, can log into TimeCruncher to view their profile and
view the information relevant to them.

## Self sign up

Let your contractors create their own profiles so you don't have to. They can sign themselves up, fill in their details
 including data such as their skills and qualifications, upload a CV and profile picture, and much more.

With our embeddable enquiry form clients can get in contact with you and their details are added to TimeCruncher.

## Customisable profiles

Between our range of customisable fields you can record anything you want about your users, be it if they can drive or
 how they heard about your business. You can then report on them to find out, for instance, how many of the users that where created
 last month where attracted by your most recent ad campaign?

 contractors by anything you want, such as where they live, what skills or qualifications they have, or even any of the customised
 fields you have created, so you can find the right match for your client quickly and easily.
