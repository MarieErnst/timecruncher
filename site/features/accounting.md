## Automatic Invoicing + Payroll

Dealing with accounting effectively is time consuming, wouldn't it be great if you had more time to grow your business?

TimeCruncher automatically generates your invoices using the data from appointments, so you can be sure that you are
 billing for the correct amount. The draft invoices can then be reviewed and sent to your clients.

## Customisable Invoices

A professional invoice is important for you to portray the correct image to the client, so we've created smart looking
 invoices that contain your own logo and address details.

You can even tailor them further for your business with our editable templates.

## Tax Calculations included

Unlike other business management software, TimeCruncher automatically calculates tax on invoices,
 which can be applied in any way, depending on the model of your business and your tax setup.

If you are a service provider and supply a direct service to your clients then tax can be calculated on the
 full amount of the job. However if you are acting as an agent for your contractors then TimeCruncher allows you
 to charge for the job via the contractor. This means that because you are acting as an agent and not a service provider
 that the tax will only be charged on the commission that the contractor pays you, giving you the obvious benefits.

## Credit Control

Managing credit control is easy - TimeCruncher will show you who hasn't paid and, by sending them a reminder,
 you can make sure your clients always remember to pay. Since the main reason for bad debtors is simply forgetting to pay,
 we've made it as easy as possible for clients to pay using our online payments.

## Paying your Contractors

As well as automating the invoicing process, TimeCruncher generates Payment Orders for you to send to your contractors to
let them know how much you are paying them, and what for.

## Exporting Accounting Information

You can export your accounting information in to whichever accounting package you use to manage your books; you'll quickly
 be able to see any discrepancies that need to be taken care of.
