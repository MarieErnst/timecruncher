Spanish and Coffee is based in London and consists of a small team of carefully selected native Spanish tutors from Spain and Latin America. All tutors are highly qualified, very experienced, and share a passion for making classes as fun, engaging and personalised as possible.

Spanish and Coffee offers private, group and online Spanish lessons to individuals and businesses. Private lessons are offered to 1 - 5 students at a time, and are offered throughout London at student’s offices, homes or even their favourite coffee shops. Public group courses are held in Putney and Spanish and Coffee proudly limits group classes to only 8 students to maximise each students learning potential. Online lessons are provided to individual students around the world. 

Students range from GCSE, A-Level and university level students to adults who just want to learn Spanish - be it for personal, travel or professional reasons. Spanish and Coffee hosts regular Spanish orientated social events for students to practice and be exposed to the Spanish language outside their lessons, and to learn more about Spanish and Latin culture.

Spanish and Coffee offers free Spanish language assessments and ensures each student’s lessons are tailored to their level and goals. Students can monitor their learning progress online and email their teachers at any time. Classes can be paid on a weekly basis and lesson times and locations can be changed as frequently as students wish. This flexible learning model has proven extremely popular - especially with students who have very busy and unpredictable schedules and need greater flexibility.
