Tutor Doctor was started in Toronto, in Canada in 2001 by a gentleman called John Hooi. John had been in education for a
long time and had his own learning centre which is how the majority of tutoring takes place in North America.
Brilliantly. Tutor Doctor has pretty much nationwide coverage in Canada now and they’re growing at a vast rate in the US
too. And in 2007 Tutor Doctor first came to the UK. Whilst learning centres do exist in the UK, they don’t dominate in
the way they do in the US and Canada. They can of course offer huge benefits to the students who use them and especially
younger kids can make great strides by working in a different environment with a skilled facilitator who will issue
exercises and worksheets, supervising their completion in very small groups and supplementing what the kids have been
doing in their schools.
