Winterwood Tutors is a joint venture managed by the co-founders, Thomas Parkinson and Jade Everingham. Both founders had
worked for several years as private tutors in London, and decided to found an agency with a unique ethos, taking
advantage of their higher education experience, and the high quality postgraduate tutors they had access to through
their university networks. The agency promotes an advanced, academic style of learning, whilst also ensuring that
tuition is fit-to-purpose and carefully tailored to exam requirements and curriculum.
