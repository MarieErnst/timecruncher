Greycoat Placements was founded in 1996 and from the very beginning the driving philosophy has always been one of
professionalism, integrity and trust. The company is determined to deliver an unrivalled service to its Clients and
Candidates. The company began with a staff of two and has grown enormously since then, developing the business into
further sectors, expanding the Catering & Hospitality sector by the acquisition of Lumleys in 2008, subsequently
becoming Greycoat Lumleys , and expanding our Childcare sector to include Education, whereby they can now also source
Private Tutors and Pastoral Staff for Independent Schools.
