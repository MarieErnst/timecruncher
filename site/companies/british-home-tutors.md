British Home Tutors (BHT) is a collegiate group of around 60 school teachers who work or have worked at independent
schools in the London area such as Westminster, St Paul’s, Latymer, Eton, Harrow, UCS, Highgate, Bute House and other
top performing English private schools. They are a small organisation who have been operating in central London for
almost 20 years. Their intention is to remain small so that they can retain strong quality control over what they
provide. This means that at certain times of the academic year, demand exceeds supply for their services.
