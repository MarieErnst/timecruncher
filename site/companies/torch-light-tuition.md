Torchlight Tuition was set up and is run entirely by one person. This means a guaranteed personal and professional
service. Unlike many other agencies, all of Torchlight Tuitionâ€™s tutors have a full face to face interview and
assessment. Tutors are only taken on if they meet our high standards. They are carefully monitored and evaluated
throughout their time with us. To ensure your peace of mind, all tutors must have a full and current CRB certificate.
