Carfax College specializes in providing excellent schooling, delivered one-on-one by world-class tutors, many of whom have taught at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and at Britain's leading independent schools. Carfax has an excellent track-record for sending pupils on to study at the world’s top universities, with candidates receiving offers from Oxford, Cambridge, the University of London, as well as highly ranked universities in the United States of America. Carfax Oxford has also successfully prepared pupils for competitive entry to a wide variety of England’s best schools, including Charterhouse, Cheltenham, Eton, Downe, Oundle, Rugby and Winchester. Whether one-year A-levels and GCSEs, re-takes, intensive revision, support alongside school studies, or individual provision for highly gifted pupils, Carfax Oxford is proud of providing the highest level of academic attention and pastoral care to each individual pupil. The Independent Schools Inspectorate concluded in May 2015 that at Carfax, “the quality of the curriculum, teaching and learners’ achievements are excellent. Results in external examinations are very good.”
