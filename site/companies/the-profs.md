The Profs is a collective of highly qualified educators that provide personal tuition and academic mentoring to students of all ages, in all disciplines, from 11+ to PhD and professional qualifications. Our aim is to create a global knowledge sharing platform. Through our online service, our Profs are also working with students on every continent - from the US, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and South America.
 
The Profs work with 300+ vetted academics that have helped students in subjects as diverse as econometrics, epidemiology, accounting, JAVA, and visual arts. We have worked with students with physical impairments and learning difficulties, sent tutors to exotic countries to teach at a dayâ€™s notice, taught start-ups how to analyse data, worked with royalty, and even created bespoke courses on demand.
